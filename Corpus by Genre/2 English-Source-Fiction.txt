<p><s>A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead.</s> <s>I say 'one chooses ' with the inaccurate pride of a professional writer who—when he has been seriously noted at all—has been praised for his technical ability, but do I in fact of my own will choose that black wet January night on the Common, in 1946, the sight of Henry Miles slanting across the wide river of rain, or did these images choose me?</s> <s>It is convenient, it is correct according to the rules of my craft to begin just there, but if I had believed then in a God, I could also have believed in a hand, plucking at my elbow, a suggestion, "Speak to him: he hasn't seen you yet."</s></p>
<p><s>For why should I have spoken'to him?</s> <s>If hate is not too large a term to use in relation to any human being, I hated Henry—I hated his wife Sarah too.</s> <s>And he, I suppose, came soon after the events of that evening to Hate me: as he surely at times must have hated his wife and that other, in whom in those days we were lucky enough not to believe.</s> <s>So this is a record of hate far more than of love, and if I come to say anything in favour of Henry and Sarah I can be trusted: I am writing against the bias because it is my professional pride to prefer the near-truth, even to the expression of my near-hate.</s> <s>It was strange to see Henry out on such a night: he liked his comfort and after all—or so I thought—he had Sarah.</s> <s>To me comfort is like the wrong memory at the wrong place or time: if one is lonely one prefers discomfort.</s> <s>There was too much comfort even in the bed-sitting-room I had at the wrong—the south—side of the Common, in the relics of other people's furniture.</s> <s>I thought I would go for a walk through the rain and have a drink at the local.</s> <s>The little crowded hall wa?</s> <s>full of strangers' hats and coats and I took somebody else's umbrella by accident—the man on the second floor had friends in.</s> <s>Then I closed the stained-glass door behind me and made my way carefully down the steps that had been blasted in 1944 and never repaired.</s> <s>I had reason to remember the occasion and how the stained glass, tough and ugly and Victorian, stood up to the shock as our grandfathers themselves would have done.</s></p>
<p><s>Directly I began to cross the Common I realised I had the wrong umbrella, for it sprang a leak and the rain ran down under my macintosh collar, and then it was I saw Henry.</s> <s>I could so easily have avoided him; he had no umbrella and in the light of the lamp I could see his eyes were blinded with the rain.</s> <s>The black leafless trees, gave no protection: they stood around like broken water-pipes; and the rain dripped off his stiff dark hat and ran in streams down his black civil servant's overcoat.</s> <s>If I had walked straight by him, he wouldn't have seen me, and I could have made certain by stepping two feet off the pavement, but I said, "Henry, you are almost a stranger," and saw his eyes light up as though we were old friends.</s></p>
<p><s>"Bendrix," he said with affection, and yet the world would have said he had the reasons for hate, not me.</s></p>
<p><s>"What are you up to, Henry, in the rain?"</s> <s>There are men whom one has an irresistible desire to tease: men whose virtues one doesn't share.</s> <s>He said evasively, "Oh, I wanted a bit of air," and during a sudden blast of wind and rain he just caught his hat in time from being whirled away towards the north side.</s></p>
<p><s>"How's Sarah?"</s> <s>I asked because it might have seemed odd if I hadn't, though nothing would have delighted me more than to have heard that she was sick, unhappy, dying.</s> <s>I imagined in those days that any suffering she underwent would lighten mine, and if she were dead I could be free: I would no longer imagine all the things one does imagine under my ignoble circumstances.</s> <s>I could even like poor silly Henry, I thought, if Sarah were dead.</s></p>
<p><s>He said, "Oh, she's out for the evening somewhere," and set that devil in my mind at work again, remembering other days when Henry must have replied just like that to other inquirers, while I alone knew where Sarah was.</s> <s>"A drink?"</s> <s>I asked, and to my surprise he put himself in step beside me.</s> <s>We had never before drunk together outside his home.</s></p>
<p><s>"It's a long time since we've seen you, Bendrix."</s> <s>For some reason I am a man known by his surname—I might never have been christened for all the use my friends make of the rather affected Maurice my literary parents gave me.</s></p>
<p><s>"A long time."</s></p>
<p><s>"Why, it must be—more than a year."</s></p>
<p><s>"June 1944," I said.</s></p>
<p><s>"As long as that—well, well."</s> <s>The fool, I thought, the fool to see nothing strange in a year and a half's interval.</s> <s>Less than five hundred yards of flat grass separated our two "sides".</s> <s>Had it never occurred to him to say to Sarah, "How's Bendrix doing?</s> <s>What about asking Bendrix in?"</s> <s>and hadn't her replies ever seemed to him • .</s> <s>.</s> <s>odd, evasive, suspicious?</s> <s>I had fallen out of their sight as completely as a stone in a pond.</s> <s>I suppose the ripples may have disturbed Sarah for a week, a month .</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>but Henry's blinkers were so firmly tied.</s> <s>I had hated his blinkers even when I had benefited from them, knowing that others could benefit too.</s></p>
<p><s>"Is she at the cinema?"</s> <s>I asked.</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh no, she hardly ever goes."</s></p>
<p><s>"She used to."</s></p>
<p><s>The "Pontefract Arms" was still decorated for Christmas with paper streamers and paper bells, the relics on commercial gaiety, mauve and orange, and the young landlady leant her breasts against the bar with a look of contempt for her customers.</s></p>
<p><s>"Pretty," Henry said, without meaning it, and stared around with a certain lost air, a shyness, for somewhere to hang his hat.</s> <s>I got the impression that the nearest he had ever before been to a public bar was the chop house off Northumberland Avenue where he ate lunch with his colleagues from the Ministry.</s> <s>"What will you have?"</s> <s>"I wouldn't mind a whisky."</s></p>
<p><s>"Nor would I, but you'll have to make do with rum."</s></p>
<p><s>We sat at a table and fingered our glasses: I had never had much to say to Henry.</s> <s>I doubt whether I should ever have troubled to know Henry or Sarah well if I had not begun in 1939 to write a story with a senior civil servant as the main character.</s> <s>Henry James once, in a discussion with Walter Besant, said that a young woman with sufficient talent need only pass the mess-room windows of a Guards' barracks and look inside in order to write a novel about the Brigade, but I think at some stage of her book she would have found it necessary to go to bed with a Guardsman if only in order to check on the details.</s> <s>I didn't exactly go to bed with Henry, but I did the next best thing, and the first night I took Sarah out to dinner I had the cold-blooded intention of picking the brain of a civil servant's wife.</s> <s>She didn't know what I was at; she thought, I am sure, I was genuinely interested in her family life, and perhaps that first awakened her liking for me.</s> <s>What time did Henry have breakfast?</s> <s>I asked her.</s> <s>Did he go to the office by tube, bus or taxi?</s> <s>Did he bring his work home at night?</s> <s>Did he have a brief-case with the royal arms on it?</s> <s>Our friendship blossomed under my interest: she was so pleased that anybody should take Henry seriously.</s> <s>Henry was important, but important rather as an elephant is important, from the size of his department; there are some kinds of importance that remain hopelessly damned to unseriousness.</s> <s>Henry was an important assistant secretary in the Ministry of Pensions—later it was to be the Ministry of Home Security.</s> <s>Home Security—I used to laugh at that later in those moments when you hate Your companion and look for any weapon ...</s> <s>A time came when I deliberately told Sarah that I had only taken Henry up for the purpose of copy, copy too for a character who was the ridiculous, the comic element in my book.</s> <s>It was then she began to dislike my novel.</s> <s>She had an enormous loyalty to Henry (I could never deny that), and in those clouded hours when the demon took charge of my brain and I resented even harmless Henry, I would use the novel and invent episodes too crude to write.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>Once when Sarah had spent a whole night with me (I had looked forward to it as a writer looks forward to the last word of his book) I had spoilt the occasion suddenly by a chance word which broke the mood of what sometimes seemed for hours at a time a complete love.</s> <s>I had fallen sullenly asleep about two and woke at three, and putting my hand on her arm woke Sarah.</s> <s>I think I had meant to make everything well again, until my victim turned her face, bleary and beautiful with sleep and full of trust towards me.</s> <s>She had forgotten the quarrel, and I found even in her forgetfulness a new cause.</s> <s>How twisted we humans are, and yet they say a God made us; but I find it hard to conceive of any God who is not as simple as perfect equation, as clear as air.</s> <s>I said to her, "I've lair awake thinking of Chapter Five.</s> <s>Does Henry ever eat coffee beans to clear his breath before an important conference?"</s> <s>She shook her head and began to cry silently, and I of course pretended not to understand the reason—a simple question, it had been worrying me about my character, this was not an attack on Henry, the nicest people sometimes eat coffee beans.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>So I went on She wept awhile and went to sleep—she was a good sleeper, and I took even her power to sleep as an added offence.</s></p>
<p><s>Henry drank his rum quickly, his gaze wandering miserably among the mauve and orange streamers, I asked, "Had a good Christmas?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Very nice.</s> <s> Very nice," he said.</s></p>
<p><s>"At home?"</s> <s>Henry looked up at me as though my inflection of the word sounded strange.</s></p>
<p><s>"Home?</s> <s> Yes, of course."</s></p>
<p><s>"And Sarah's well?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"Have another rum?"</s></p>
<p><s>"It's my turn."</s> <s>While Henry fetched the drinks I went into the lavatory.</s> <s>The walls were scrawled with phrases: "Damn you, landlord, and your breasty wife."</s> <s>"To all pimps and whores a merry syphilis and a happy gonorrhea."</s> <s>I went quickly out again to the cheery paper streamers and the clink of glass.</s> <s>Sometimes I see myself reflected too closely in other men for comfort, and then I have an enormous wish to believe in the saints, in heroic virtue.</s></p>
<p><s>I repeated to Henry the two lines I had seen.</s> <s>I wanted to shock him, and it surprised me when he said simply, "Jealousy's an awful thing."</s> <s>"You mean the bit about the breasty wife?"</s> <s>"Both of them.</s> <s>When you are miserable, you envy other people's happiness."</s></p>
<p><s>It wasn't what I had ever expected him to learn in the Ministry of Home Security.</s> <s>And there—in that phrase—the bitterness leaks again out of my pen.</s> <s>What a dull lifeless quality this bitterness is.</s> <s>" I could I would write with love, but if I could write with love, I would be another man: I would never have lost love.</s> <s>Yet suddenly across the shiny tiled surface of the bar-table I felt something, nothing so extreme as love perhaps  nothing  more than a  companionship  in misfortune.</s> <s> I said to Henry, "Are you miserable?"</s> <s>"Bendrix, I'm worried."</s> <s>"Tell me."</s></p>
<p><s>I expect it was the rum that made him speak, or was he partly aware of how much I knew about him?</s> <s>Sarah was loyal, but in a relationship such as ours had been you can't help picking up a thing or two.</s> <s>...</s> <s>I knew he had a mole on the left of his navel because a birthmark of my own had once reminded Sarah of it: I knew he suffered from short sight, but wouldn't wear glasses with strangers (and I was still enough of a stranger never to have seen him in them): I knew his liking for tea at ten: I even knew his sleeping habits.</s> <s>Was he conscious that I knew so much already, that one more fact would not aha our relation?</s> <s>He said.</s> <s>"I'm worried about Sarah, Bendrix."</s></p>
<p><s>The door of the bar opened and I could see the rain lashing down against the light.</s> <s>A little hilarious man darted in and called out, "Wot cher, everybody," and nobody answered.</s></p>
<p><s>"Is she ill?</s> <s> I thought you said ..."</s></p>
<p><s>"No.</s> <s>Not ill.</s> <s>I don't think so."</s> <s>He looked miserably around—this was not his milieu.</s> <s>I noticed that the whites of his eyes were bloodshot; perhaps he hadn't bed wearing his glasses enough—there are always so many strangers, or it might have been the after-effect of tears.</s> <s>He said, "Bendrix, I can't talk here," as though he had once been in the habit of talking somewhere.</s> <s>"Come home with me."</s></p>
<p><s>"Will Sarah be back?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I don't expect so."</s></p>
<p><s>I paid for the drinks, and that again was a sympton of Henry's disturbance—he never took other people's hospitality easily.</s> <s>He was always the one in a taxi to have the money ready in the palm of his hand, while we others fumbled.</s> <s>The avenues of the Common still ran with rain, but it wasn't far to Henry's.</s> <s>He let himself in with a latch-key under the Queen Anne fanlight and called, "Sarah.</s> <s>Sarah."</s> <s>I longed for a reply and dreaded a reply, but nobody answered.</s> <s>He said, "She's out still.</s> <s>Come into the study."</s></p>
<p><s>I had never been in his study before: I had always been Sarah's friend, and when I met Henry it was on Sarah's territory, her haphazard living-room where nothing matched, nothing was period or planned, where every' thing seemed to belong to that very week because nothing was ever allowed to remain as a token of past taste or past sentiment.</s> <s>Everything was used there; just as in Henry's study I now felt that very little had ever been used.</s> <s>I doubted whether the set of Gibbon had once been opened, and the set of Scott was only there because it had -probably—belonged to his father, like the bronze copy of the Discus Thrower.</s> <s>And yet he was happier in his Unused room simply because it was his: his possession.</s> <s>I thought with bitterness and envy: if one possesses a thing securely, one need never use it.</s></p>
<p><s>"A whisky?"</s> <s>Henry said.</s> <s>  I remembered his eyes and wondered if he were drinking more than he had done in the old days.</s> <s> Certainly the whiskies he poured out were generous doubles.</s></p>
<p><s>"What's troubling you, Henry?"</s> <s>I asked.</s> <s>I had long abandoned that novel about the senior civil servant: I wasn't looking for copy any longer.</s> <s>"Sarah," he said.</s></p>
<p><s>Would I have been frightened if he had said that, in just that way, two years ago?</s> <s>No, I think I should have been overjoyed—one gets so hopelessly tired of deception I would have welcomed the open fight if only because there might have been a chance, however small, that through some error of tactics on his side I might have won.</s> <s>And there has never been a time in my life before or since when I have so much wanted to win.</s> <s>I have never had so strong a desire even to write a good book.</s></p>
<p><s>He looked up at me with those red-rimmed eyes and said, "Bendrix, I'm afraid."</s> <s>I could no longer patronial him: he was one of misery's graduates: he had passed in the same school, and for the first time I thought of him as an equal.</s> <s>I remember there was one of those early brown photographs in an Oxford frame on his desk, the photograph of his father, and looking at it I thought how like the photograph was to Henry (it had been taken at about the same age, the middle forties) and how unlike It wasn't the moustache that made it different—it was the Victorian look of confidence, of being at home in the world and knowing the way around, and suddenly I felt again that friendly sense of companionship.</s> <s>I liked him better than I would have liked his father (who had been in the Treasury).</s> <s>We were fellow strangers.</s></p>
<p><s>"What is it you're afraid of, Henry?"</s></p>
<p><s>He sat down in an easy chair as though somebody had pushed him and said with disgust, "Bendrix, I've always thought the worst thing, the very worst, a man could do.</s> <s>..."</s> <s>I should certainly have been on tenterhooks in those other days: strange to me, and how infinitely-dreary, the serenity of innocence.</s></p>
<p><s>"You know you can trust me, Henry."</s> <s>It was possible, I thought, that she had kept a letter, though I had written so few.</s> <s>It is a professional risk that authors run.</s> <s>Women are apt to exaggerate the importance of their lovers and they never foresee the disappointing day when an indiscreet letter will appear marked "Interesting" in an autograph catalogue priced at five shillings.</s> <s>"Take a look at this then.</s> <s>Henry said.</s></p>
<p><s>He held a letter out to me: it was not in my handwriting.</s> <s>"Go on.</s> <s>Read it," Henry said.</s> <s>It was from some friend of Henry's and he wrote, "I suggest the man you want to help should apply to a fellow called Savage, 159 Vigo Street.</s> <s>I found him able and discreet, and his employees seemed less nauseous than those chaps usually are."</s></p>

<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.</s> <s>In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels.</s> <s>Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees.</s> <s>The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterwards the road bare and white except for the leaves.</s></p>
<p><s>The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the mountains were brown and bare.</s> <s>There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flashes from the artillery.</s> <s>In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling of a storm coming.</s></p>
<p><s>Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-tractors.</s> <s>There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their pack-saddles and grey motor-trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic.</s> <s>There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the long barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy branches and vines laid over the tractors.</s> <s>To the north we could look across a valley and see a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another mountain on this side of the river.</s> <s>There was fighting for that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain.</s> <s>The vineyards were thin and bare-branched too and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn.</s> <s>There were mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed mud on the roads and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, grey leather boxes heavy with the packs of clips of thin, long 6.5 mm.</s> <s>cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on the road, marched as though they were six months gone with child.</s></p>
<p><s>There were small grey motor-cars that passed going very fast; usually there was an officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in the back seat.</s> <s>They splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of the officers in the back was very small and sitting between two generals, he himself so small that you could not see his face but only the top of his cap and his narrow back, and if the car went especially fast it was probably the King.</s> <s>He lived in Udine and came out in this way nearly every day to see how things were going, and things went very badly.</s></p>
<p><s>At the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain came the cholera.</s> <s>But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the army.</s></p>
<C Chapter 2>
<p><s>The next year there were many victories.</s> <s>The mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine purple on the side of the house.</s> <s>Now the fighting was in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away.</s> <s>The town was very nice and our house was very fine.</s> <s>The river ran behind us and the town had been captured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if the war should end, because they did not bombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way.</s> <s>People lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafes and artillery up side streets and two bawdy-houses, one for troops and one for officers, and with the end of the summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the fighting had been, the trees around the square and the long avenue of trees that led to the square; these with there being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor-car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long-necked body and grey beard like a goat's chin-tuft; all these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing going well on the Carso made the fall very different from the last fall when we had been in the country.</s> <s>The war was changed too.</s></p>
<p><s>The forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the town was gone.</s> <s>The forest had been green in the summer when we had come into the town but now there were the stumps and the broken trunks and the ground torn up, and one day at the end of the fall when I was out where the oak forest had been I saw a cloud coming over the mountain.</s> <s>It came very fast and the sun went a dull yellow and then everything was grey and the sky was covered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in it and it was snow.</s> <s>The snow slanted across the wind, the bare ground was covered, the stumps of trees projected, there was snow on the guns and there were paths in the snow going back to the latrines behind trenches.</s></p>
<p><s>Later, below in the town, I watched the snow falling, looking out of the window of the bawdy-house, the house for officers, where I sat with a friend and two glasses drinking a bottle of Asti, and, looking out at the snow falling slowly and heavily, we knew it was all over for that year.</s> <s>Up the river the mountains had not been taken; none of the mountains beyond the river had been taken.</s> <s>That was all left for next year.</s> <s>My friend saw the priest from our mess going by in the street, walking carefully in the slush, and pounded on the window to attract his attention.</s> <s>The priest looked up.</s> <s>He saw us and smiled.</s> <s>My friend motioned for him to come in.</s> <s>The priest shook his head and went on.</s></p>
<p><s>That night in the mess after the spaghetti course, which every one ate very quickly and seriously, lifting the spaghetti on the fork until the loose strands hung clear then lowering it into the mouth, or else using a continuous lift and sucking into the mouth, helping ourselves to wine from the grass-covered gallon flask; it swung in a metal cradle and you pulled the neck of the flask down with the forefinger and the wine, clear red, tannic and lovely, poured out into the glass held with the same hand; after this course, the captain commenced picking on the priest.</s></p>
<p><s>The priest was young and blushed easily and wore a uniform like the rest of us but with a cross in dark red velvet above the left breast-pocket of his grey tunic.</s> <s>The captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubtful benefit, in order that I might understand perfectly, that nothing should be lost.</s></p>
<p><s>'Priest today with girls,' the captain said looking at the priest and at me.</s> <s>The priest smiled and blushed and shook his head.</s> <s>The captain baited him often.</s></p>
<p><s>'Not true?'</s> <s>asked the captain.</s> <s>'Today I see priest with girls.'</s> <s>'No,' said the priest.</s> <s>The other officers were amused at the baiting.</s></p>
<p><s>'Priest not with girls,' went on the captain.</s> <s>'Priest never with girls,' he explained to me.</s> <s>He took my glass and filled it, looking at my eyes all the time, but not losing sight of the priest.</s></p>
<p><s>'Priest every night five against one,' Every one at the table laughed.</s> <s>'You understand?</s> <s>Priest every night five against one.' He made a gesture and laughed loudly.</s> <s>The priest accepted it as a joke.</s></p>
<p><s>'The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war,' the major said.</s> <s>'He loves Franz Joseph.</s> <s>That's where the money comes from.</s> <s>I am an atheist.'</s></p>
<p><s>'Did you ever read the Black Pig?'</s> <s>asked the lieutenant.</s> <s>'I will get you a copy.</s> <s>It was that which shook my faith.'</s></p>
<p><s>'It is a filthy and vile book,' said the priest.</s> <s>'You do not really like it.'</s></p>
<p><s>'It is very valuable,' said the lieutenant.</s> <s>'It tells you about those priests.</s> <s>You will like it,' he said to me.</s> <s>I smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the candle-light.</s> <s>'Don't you read it,' he said.</s></p>
<p><s>'I will get it for you,' said the lieutenant.</s></p>
<p><s>'All thinking men are atheists,' the major said.</s> <s>'I do not believe in the Freemasons however.'</s></p>
<p><s>'I believe in the Freemasons,' the lieutenant said.</s> <s>It is a noble organization.'</s> <s>Someone came in and as the door opened I could see the snow falling.</s></p>
<p><s>'There will be no more offensive now that the snow has come,' I said.</s></p>
<p><s>'Certainly not,' said the major.</s> <s>'You should go on leave.</s> <s>You should go to Rome, Naples, Sicily - '</p>
<p><s>'He should visit Amalfi,' said the lieutenant.</s> <s>'I will write you cards to my family in Amalfi.</s> <s>They will love you like a son.'</s> <s>'He should go to Palermo.'</s> <s>'He ought to go to Capri.'</s></p>
<p><s>'I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family at Capracotta,' said the priest.</s></p>
<p><s>'Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi.</s> <s>There's more snow there than here.</s> <s>He doesn't want to see peasants.</s> <s>Let him go to centres of culture and civilization.'</s></p>
<p><s>'He should have fine girls.</s> <s>I will give you the addresses of places in Naples.</s> <s>Beautiful young girls - accompanied by their mothers.</s> <s>Ha!</s> <s>Ha!</s> <s>Ha!'</p>
<p><s>He looked at the priest and shouted, 'Every night priest five against one!'</s> <s>They all laughed again.</s></p>
<p><s>'You must go on leave at once,' the major said.</s> <s>'I would like to go with you and show you things,' the lieutenant said.</s></p>
<p><s>'When you come back bring a phonograph.'</s> <s>'Bring good opera disks.'</s> <s>'Bring Caruso.'</s></p>
<p><s>'Don't bring Caruso.</s> <s>He bellows.'</s> <s>'Don't you wish you could bellow like him?'</s> <s>'He bellows.</s> <s>I say he bellows!'</p>
<p><s>'I would like you to go to Abruzzi,' the priest said.</s> <s>The others were shouting.</s> <s>'There is good hunting.</s> <s>You would like the people and though it is cold it is clear and dry.</s> <s>You could stay with my family.</s> <s>My father is a famous hunter.'</s></p>

<p><s>He did not think Miriam would be having a child unless she wanted it.</s> <s>Which should mean the lover intended to marry her.</s> <s>But why had she sent for him?</s> <s>She didn't need him to get a divorce.</s> <s>And why did he go over the same dull ground he had four days ago when he had gotten her letter?</s> <s>The five or six lines in Miriam's round handwriting had said only that she was going to have a child and wanted to see him That she was pregnant guaranteed the divorce, he reasoned, so why was he nervous?</s> <s>A suspicion that he might, in some unreachable depth of himself, be jealous because she was going to bear another man's child and had once aborted his own tormented him above all.</s> <s>No, it was nothing but shame that nettled him, he told himself, shame that he had once loved such a person as Miriam.</s> <s>He mashed his cigarette on the heater's grilled cover.</s> <s>The stub rolled out at his feet, and he kicked it back under the heater.</s></p>
<p><s>There was so much to look forward to now.</s> <s>His divorce, the work in Florida—it was practically certain the board would pass on his drawings, and he would learn this week—and Anne.</s> <s>He and Anne could begin to plan now.</s> <s>For over a year he had been waiting, fretting, for something—this—to happen so he would be free.</s> <s>He felt a pleasant explosion of happiness inside him.</s> <s>and relaxed in the corner of the plush seal.</s> <s>For the last three years, really, he had been waiting for this to happen.</s> <s>He could have bought a divorce, of course, but he hadn't ever amassed that much spare money.</s> <s>Starting a career as an architect, without benefit of a job with a firm, had not been easy and still wasn't.</s> <s>Miriam had never asked for an income, but she plagued him in other ways, by talking of him in Metcalf as if they were still on the best of terms, as if he were up in New York only to establish himself and eventually send for her.</s> <s>Occasionally she wrote him for money, small but irritating amounts which he let her have because it would be so easy for her, so natural to her.</s> <s>to start a campaign in Metcalf against him, and his mother was in Metcalf.</s></p>
<p><s>A tall blond young man in a rust-brown suit dropped into the empty seat opposite Guy and.</s> <s>smiling with a vague friendliness, did over into the corner.</s> <s>Guy glanced at his pallid, undersized face.</s> <s>There was a huge pimple in the exact center of his forehead.</s> <s>Guy looked out the window again.</s></p>
<p><s>The young nun opposite him seemed to debate whether to start a conversation or take a nap.</s> <s>His elbow kept sliding along the window sill, and whenever the stubby lashes came open, the gray bloodshot eyes were looking at him and the soft smile came back.</s> <s>He might have been slightly drunk.</s></p>
<p><s>Guy opened his book, but his mind wandered after half a page.</s> <s>He looked up as the row of white fluorescent lights flickered on down the ceiling of the car, let his eyes wander to the unlighted cigar that still gyrated conversationally in a bony hand behind one of the seat backs, and to the monogram that trembled on a thin gold chain across the tie of the young man opposite him.</s> <s>The monogram was CAB, and the tie was of green silk, hand-painted with offensively orange-colored palm trees.</s> <s>The long rust-brown body was sprawled vulnerably now, the head thrown back so that the big pimple or boil on the forehead might have been a topmost point that had erupted.</s> <s>It was an interesting face, though Guy did not know why.</s> <s>It looked neither young nor old, neither intelligent nor entirely stupid.</s> <s>Between the narrow bulging forehead and the lantern jaw, it scooped degenerately, deep where the mouth lay in a fine line, deepest in the blue hollows that held the small scallops of the lids.</s> <s>The skin was smooth as a girl's, even waxenly clear, as if all its impurities had been drained to feed the pimple's outburst.</s></p>
<p><s>For a few moments, Guy read again.</s> <s>The words made sense to him and began to lift his anxiety.</s> <s>But what good will Plato do you with Miriam, an inner voice asked him.</s> <s>It had asked him that in New York, but he had brought the book anyway, an old text from a high school philosophy course, an indulgence to compensate him, perhaps, for having to make the trip to Miriam.</s></p>
<p><s>He looked out the window and, seeing his own image, straightened his curling collar.</s> <s>Anne was always doing that for him.</s> <s>Suddenly he fell helpless without her.</s> <s>He shifted his position.</s> <s>accidentally touched the outstretched foot of the young man asleep, and watched fascinatedly as the lashes twitched and came open.</s> <s>The bloodshot eyes might have been focused on him all the while through the lids.</s></p>
<p><s>"Sorry."</s> <s>Guy murmured.</s></p>
<p><s>'"S all right."</s> <s>the other said He sat up and shook his head sharply.</s> <s>"Where are we?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Getting into Texas."</s></p>
<p><s>The blond young man brought a gold flask from his inside pocket, opened it.</s> <s>and extended it amiably.</s></p>
<p><s>"No.</s> <s>thanks."</s> <s>Guy said.</s> <s>The woman across the aisle.</s> <s>Guy noticed, who had not looked up from her knitting since St.</s> <s>Louis, glanced over just as the flask upended with a metallic splash</p>
<p><s>"Where you bound?"</s> <s>The smile was a thin wet crescent now.</s></p>
<p><s>"Metcalf."</s> <s>Guy said.</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh.</s> <s>Nice town.</s> <s>Metcalf.</s> <s>Down on business?"</s> <s>He blinked his sore-looking eyes politely.</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"What business?"</s></p>
<p><s>Guy looked up reluctantly from his book.</s> <s>"Architect."</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh."</s> <s>with wistful interest.</s> <s>"Build houses and things?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"I don't think I've introduced myself."</s> <s>He half stood up.</s> <s>"Bruno.</s> <s>Charles Anthony Bruno."</s></p>
<p><s>Guy shook his hand briefly.</s> <s>"Guy Haines."</s></p>
<p><s>"Glad to meet you.</s> <s>You live in New York?"</s> <s>The hoarse baritone voice sounded false, as if he were talking to wake himself up.</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"I live in Long Island.</s> <s>Going to Santa Fe for a little vacation.</s> <s>Ever been to Santa Fe?"</s></p>
<p><s>Guy shook his head.</s></p>
<p><s>"Great town to relax in."</s> <s>He smiled, showing poor teeth.</s> <s>"Mostly Indian architecture there, I guess."</s></p>
<p><s>A conductor stopped in the aisle, thumbing through tickets.</s> <s>"That your seat?"</s> <s>he asked Bruno.</s></p>
<p><s>Bruno leaned possessively into his corner.</s> <s>"Drawing room next car."</s></p>
<p><s>"Number Three?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I guess.</s> <s>Yeah."</s></p>
<p><s>The conductor went on.</s></p>
<p><s>"Those guys!"</s> <s>Bruno murmured.</s> <s>He leaned forward and gazed out the window amusedly.</s></p>
<p><s>Guy went back to his book, but the other's obtrusive boredom, a feeling he was about to say something in another instant, kept him from concentrating.</s> <s>Guy contemplated going to the diner, but for some reason sat on.</s> <s>The tram was slowing again.</s> <s>When Bruno looked as if he were going to speak, Guy got up, retreated into the next car.</s> <s>and leapt the steps to the crunchy ground before the train had quite stopped.</s></p>
<p><s>The more organic air, weighted with nightfall, struck him like a smothering pillow.</s> <s>There was a smell of dusty, sun-warm gravel, of oil and hot metal.</s> <s>He was hungry and lingered near the diner, pacing in slow strides with his hands in his pockets, breathing the air deeply, though he disliked it.</s> <s>A constellation of red and green and white lights hummed southward in the sky.</s> <s>Yesterday, Anne might have come this route, he thought, on her way to Mexico.</s> <s>He might have been with her.</s> <s>She had wanted him to come with her as far as Mctcalf.</s> <s>He might have asked her to stay over a day and meet his mother, if it had not been for Miriam.</s> <s>Or even regardless of Miriam, if he had been another sort of person, if he could be simply unconcerned.</s> <s>He had told Anne about Miriam, about almost all of it.</s> <s>but he could not bear the thought of their meeting.</s> <s>He had wanted to travel alone on the train in order to think.</s> <s>And what had he thought so far?</s> <s>What good had thinking or logic ever been where Miriam was concerned?</s></p>
<p><s>The conductor's voice shouted a warning, but Guy paced till the last moment, then swung himself aboard the car behind the diner.</s></p>
<p><s>The waiter had just taken his order when the blond young man appeared in the doorway of the car, swaying, looking a little truculent with a short cigarette in his mouth.</s> <s>Guy had put him quite out of mind and now in his tall rust-brown figure was like a vaguely unpleasant memory.</s> <s>Guy saw him smile as he sighted him.</s></p>
<p><s>"Thought you might have missed the train."</s> <s>Bruno said cheerfully, pulling out a chair.</s></p>
<p><s>"If you don't mind, Mr. Bruno.</s> <s>I'd like some privacy for a while.</s> <s>I have some things to think over."</s></p>
<p><s>Bruno stabbed out the cigarette that was burning his ringers and looked at him blankly.</s> <s>He was drunker than before.</s> <s>His face seemed smeared and fuzzy at the edges.</s> <s>"We could have privacy in my place.</s> <s>We could have dinner there.</s> <s>How about it?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Thanks.</s> <s>I'd rather slay here."</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh.</s> <s>but I insist.</s> <s>Waiter!"</s> <s>Bruno clapped his hands.</s> <s>"Would you have this gentleman's order sent to Drawing Room Three and bring me a steak medium rare with French fries and apple pie?</s> <s>And two Scotch and sodas fast as you can.</s> <s>huh?"</s> <s>He looked at Guy and smiled, the soft wistful smile.</s> <s>"Okay?"</s></p>
<p><s>Guy debated, then got up and came with him.</s> <s>What did it matter after all?</s> <s>And wasn't he utterly sick of himself?</s></p>
<p><s>There was no need of the Scotches except to provide glasses and ice.</s> <s>The four yellow-labeled bottles of Scotch lined up on an alligator suitcase were the one neat unit of the little room.</s> <s>Suitcases and wardrobe trunks blocked passage everywhere except for a small labyrinthine area in the center of the floor, and on top of them were strewn sports clothes and equipment, tennis rackets, a bag of golf clubs, a couple of cameras, a wicker basket of fruit and wine bedded in fuchsia paper.</s> <s>A splay of current magazines, comic books and novels covered the seat by the window.</s> <s>There was also a box of candy with a red ribbon across the lid.</s></p>

<C Preface 1>
<p><s>The world has been very kind to this book.</s> <s>The sales of the English editions in their various forms have exceeded a million and a half.</s> <s>In Chicago I was assured many years ago, by an enterprising pirate now retired, that the sales throughout the United States had exceeded a million; and although, in consequence of its having been published before the Copyright Convention, this has brought me no material advantage, the fame and popularity it has won for me among the American public is an asset not to be despised.</s> <s>It has been translated into, I think, every European language, also into some of those of Asia.</s> <s>It has brought me many thousands of letters from young folk, from old folk; from well folk, from sick folk; from merry folk, from sad folk.</s> <s>They have come to me from all parts of the world, from men and women of all countries.</s> <s>Had these letters been the only result I should feel glad that I had written the book.</s> <s>I retain a few blackened pages of one copy sent me by a young colonial officer from South Africa.</s> <s>They were taken from the knapsack of a dead comrade found on Spion Kop.</s> <s>So much for testimonials.</s></p>
<p><s>It remains only to explain the merits justifying such an extraordinary success.</s> <s>I am quite unable to do so.</s> <s>I have written books that have appeared to me more clever, books that have appeared to me more humorous.</s> <s>But it is as the author of Three Men in a Boat (to say nothing of the Dog) that the public persists in remembering me.</s> <s>Certain critics used to suggest that it was the vulgarity of the book, its entire absence of humour, that accounted for its success with the people; but one feels by this time that such a suggestion does not solve the riddle.</s> <s>Bad art may succeed for a time and with a limited public; it does not go on extending its circle throughout nearly half a century.</s></p>
<p><s>I have come to the conclusion that, be the explanation what it may, I can take credit to myself for having written this book.</s> <s>That is, if I did write it.</s> <s>For really I hardly remember doing so.</s> <s>I remember only feeling very young and absurdly pleased with myself for reasons that concern only myself.</s> <s>It was summer time, and London is so beautiful in summer.</s> <s>It lay beneath my window a fairy city veiled in golden mist, for I worked in a room high up above the chimney- pots; and at night the lights shone far beneath me.</s> <s>so that I looked down as into an Aladdin's cave of jewels.</s> <s>It was during those summer months I wrote this book; it seemed the only thing to do.</s></p>
<C Preface 2>
<p><s>The chief beauty of this book lies not so much in íts literary style, or in the extent and usefulness of the information it conveys, as in its simple truthfulness.</s> <s>Its pages form the record of events that really happened.</s> <s>All that has been done is to colour them; and, for this, no extra charge has been made.</s> <s>George and Harris and Montmorency are not poetic ideals, but things of flesh and blood - especially George, who weighs about twelve stone.</s> <s>Other works may excel this in depth of thought and knowledge of human nature: other books may rival it in originality and size; but, for hopeless and incurable veracity, nothing yet discovered can surpass it.</s> <s>This, more than all its other charms, will, it is felt, make the volume precious in the eye of the earnest reader; and will lend additional weight to the lesson that the story teaches.</s></p>
<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>There were four of us - George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency.</s> <s>We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how bad we were - bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.</s></p>
<p><s>We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it.</s> <s>Harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that HE had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what HE was doing.</s> <s>With me, it was my liver that was out of order.</s> <s>I knew it was my liver that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order.</s> <s>I had them all.</s></p>
<p><s>It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form.</s> <s>The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that I have ever felt.</s></p>
<p><s>I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch - hay fever, I fancy it was.</s> <s>I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally.</s> <s>I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into - some fearful, devastating scourge, I know - and, before I had glanced half down the list of "premonitory symptoms," it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.</s></p>
<p><s>I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages.</s> <s>I came to typhoid fever - read the symptoms - discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it - wondered what else I had got; turned up St.</s> <s>Vitus's Dance - found, as I expected, that I had that too, - began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically - read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.</s></p>
<p><s>Bright's disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form, and, so far as that was concerned, I might live for years.</s> <s>Cholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have been born with.</s> <s>I plodded conscientiously through the twenty-six letters, and the only malady I could conclude I had not got was housemaid's knee.</s></p>
<p><s>I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight.</s> <s>Why hadn't I got housemaid's knee?</s> <s>Why this invidious reservation?</s> <s>After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.</s> <s>I reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and I grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid's knee.</s> <s>Gout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without my being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with from boyhood.</s> <s>There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded there was nothing else the matter with me.</s></p>
<p><s>I sat and pondered.</s> <s>I thought what an interesting case I must be from a medical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class!</s> <s>Students would have no need to "walk the hospitals," if they had me.</s> <s>I was a hospital in myself.</s> <s>All they need do would be to walk round me, and, after that, take their diploma.</s></p>
<p><s>Then I wondered how long I had to live.</s> <s>I tried to examine myself.</s> <s>I felt my pulse.</s> <s>I could not at first feel any pulse at all.</s> <s>Then, all of a sudden, it seemed to start off.</s> <s>I pulled out my watch and timed it.</s> <s>I made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute.</s> <s>I tried to feel my heart.</s> <s>I could not feel my heart.</s> <s>It had stopped beating.</s> <s>I have since been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the time, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it.</s> <s>I patted myself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back.</s> <s>But I could not feel or hear anything.</s> <s>I tried to look at my tongue.</s> <s>I stuck it out as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it with the other.</s> <s>I could only see the tip, and the only thing that I could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had scarlet fever.</s></p>
<p><s>I had walked into that reading-room a happy, healthy man.</s> <s>I crawled out a decrepit wreck.</s></p>
<p><s>I went to my medical man.</s> <s>He is an old chum of mine, and feels my pulse, and looks at my tongue, and talks about the weather, all for nothing, when I fancy I'm ill; so I thought I would do him a good turn by going to him now.</s> <s>"What a doctor wants," I said, "is practice.</s> <s>He shall have me.</s> <s>He will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your ordinary, commonplace patients, with only one or two diseases each."</s> <s>So I went straight up and saw him, and he said:</s></p>
<p><s>"Well, what's the matter with you?"</s></p>
<p><s>I said:</s> <s>"I will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what is the matter with me.</s> <s>Life is brief, and you might pass away before I had finished.</s> <s>But I will tell you what is NOT the matter with me.</s> <s>I have not got housemaid's knee.</s> <s>Why I have not got housemaid's knee, I cannot tell you; but the fact remains that I have not got it.</s> <s>Everything else, however, I HAVE got."</s></p>
<p><s>And I told him how I came to discover it all.</s></p>
<p><s>Then he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold of my wrist, and then he hit me over the chest when I wasn't expecting it - a cowardly thing to do, I call it - and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of his head.</s> <s>After that, he sat down and wrote out a prescription, and folded it up and gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.</s></p>
<p><s>I did not open it.</s> <s>I took it to the nearest chemist's, and handed it in.</s> <s>The man read it, and then handed it back.</s></p>
<p><s>He said he didn't keep it.</s></p>
<p><s>I said:</s> <s>"You are a chemist?"</s></p>
<p><s>He said:</s> <s>"I am a chemist.</s> <s>If I was a co-operative stores and family hotel combined, I might be able to oblige you.</s> <s>Being only a chemist hampers me."</s></p>
<p><s>I read the prescription.</s> <s>It ran: 1 lb. beefsteak, with 1 pt. bitter beer every 6 hours. 1 ten-mile walk every morning. 1 bed at 11 sharp every night.</s></p>
<p><s>And don't stuff up your head with things you don't understand."</s></p>
<p><s>I followed the directions, with the happy result - speaking for myself - that my life was preserved, and is still going on.</s></p>
<p><s>In the present instance, going back to the liver-pill circular, I had the symptoms, beyond all mistake, the chief among them being "a general disinclination to work of any kind."</s></p>
<p><s>What I suffer in that way no tongue can tell.</s> <s>From my earliest infancy I have been a martyr to it.</s> <s>As a boy, the disease hardly ever left me for a day.</s> <s>They did not know, then, that it was my liver.</s> <s>Medical science was in a far less advanced state than now, and they used to put it down to laziness.</s></p>
<p><s>"Why, you skulking little devil, you," they would say, "get up and do something for your living, can't you?"</s> <s>- not knowing, of course, that I was ill.</s></p>
<p><s>And they didn't give me pills; they gave me clumps on the side of the head.</s> <s>And, strange as it may appear, those clumps on the head often cured me - for the time being.</s> <s>I have known one clump on the head have more effect upon my liver, and make me feel more anxious to go straight away then and there, and do what was wanted to be done, without further loss of time, than a whole box of pills does now.</s></p>
<p><s>You know, it often is so - those simple, old-fashioned remedies are sometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff.</s></p>
<p><s>We sat there for half-an-hour, describing to each other our maladies.</s> <s>I explained to George and William Harris how I felt when I got up in the morning, and William Harris told us how he felt when he went to bed; and George stood on the hearth-rug, and gave us a clever and powerful piece of acting, illustrative of how he felt in the night.</s></p>
<p><s>George FANCIES he is ill; but there's never anything really the matter with him, you know.</s></p>
<p><s>At this point, Mrs. Poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready for supper.</s> <s>We smiled sadly at one another, and said we supposed we had better try to swallow a bit.</s> <s>Harris said a little something in one's stomach often kept the disease in check; and Mrs. Poppets brought the tray in, and we drew up to the table, and toyed with a little steak and onions, and some rhubarb tart.</s></p>
<p><s>I must have been very weak at the time; because I know, after the first half-hour or so, I seemed to take no interest whatever in my food - an unusual thing for me - and I didn't want any cheese.</s></p>
<p><s>This duty done, we refilled our glasses, lit our pipes, and resumed the discussion upon our state of health.</s> <s>What it was that was actually the matter with us, we none of us could be sure of; but the unanimous opinion was that it - whatever it was - had been brought on by overwork.</s></p>
<p><s>"What we want is rest," said Harris.</s></p>
<p><s>"Rest and a complete change," said George.</s> <s>"The overstrain upon our brains has produced a general depression throughout the system.</s> <s>Change of scene, and absence of the necessity for thought, will restore the mental equilibrium."</s></p>
<p><s>George has a cousin, who is usually described in the charge-sheet as a medical student, so that he naturally has a somewhat family-physicianary way of putting things.</s></p>

<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.</s> <s>In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.</s> <s>They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.</s> <s>They're nice and all — I'm not saying that — but they're also touchy as hell.</s> <s>Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.</s> <s>I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy.</s> <s>I mean that's all I told D.B.</s> <s>about, and he's my brother and all.</s> <s>He's in Hollywood.</s> <s>That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end.</s> <s>He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe.</s> <s>He just got a Jaguar.</s> <s>One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour.</s> <s>It cost him damn near four thousand bucks.</s> <s>He's got a lot of dough, now.</s> <s>He didn't use to.</s> <s>He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home.</s> <s>He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him.</s> <s>The best one in it was 'The Secret Goldfish.'</s> <s>It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money.</s> <s>It killed me.</s> <s>Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute.</s> <s>If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies, Don't even mention them to me.</s></p>
<p><s>Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep.</s> <s>Pencey Prep is this school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania.</s> <s>You probably heard of it.</s> <s>You've probably seen the ads, anyway.</s> <s>They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing somehot-shot guy on a horse jumping over a fence.</s> <s>Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time.</s> <s>I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place.</s> <s>And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: 'Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.1 Strictly for the birds.</s> <s>They don't do any damn more wo/ding at Pencey than they do at any other school.</s> <s>And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all.</s> <s>Maybe two guys.</s> <s>If that many.</s> <s>And they probably came to Pencey that way.</s></p>
<p><s>Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall.</s> <s>The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey.</s> <s>It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win.</s> <s>I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all.</s> <s>You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place.</s> <s>You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.</s></p>
<p><s>There were never many girls at all at the football games.</s> <s>Only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them.</s> <s>It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.</s> <s>I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something.</s> <s>Old Selma Thurmer - she was the headmaster's daughter - showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire.</s> <s>She was a pretty nice girl, though.</s> <s>I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation.</s> <s>I liked her.</s> <s>She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her.</s> <s>What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was.</s> <s>She probably knew what a phony slob he was.</s></p>
<p><s>The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team.</s> <s>I was the goddam manager of the fencing team.</s> <s>Very big deal.</s> <s>We'd gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School.</s> <s>Only, we didn't have the meet.</s> <s>I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway.</s> <s>It wasn't all my fault.</s> <s>I had to keep !</s> <s>ting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to !</s> <s> off.</s> <s>So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime.</s> <s>The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train.</s> <s>It was pretty funny, in a way.</s></p>
<p><s>The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.</s> <s>He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started.</s> <s>He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home.</s> <s>He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey.</s></p>
<p><s>I forgot to tell you about that.</s> <s>They kicked me out.</s> <s>I wasn't supposed to come back after Christmas vacation, on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all.</s> <s>They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself — especially around mid-terms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer — but I didn't do it.</s> <s>So I got the ax.</s> <s>They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey.</s> <s>It has a very good academic rating, Pencey.</s> <s>It really does.</s> <s>Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill.</s> <s>I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything.</s> <s>The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all.</s> <s>Pencey was full of crooks.</s> <s>Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway.</s> <s>The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has - I'm not kidding.</s> <s>Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off.</s> <s>Only, I wasn't watching the game too much.</s> <s>What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by.</s> <s>I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them.</s> <s>I hate that.</s> <s>I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it.</s> <s>If you don't, you feel even worse.</s></p>
<p><s>I was lucky.</s> <s>All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was !</s> <s>ting the hell out.</s> <s>I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building.</s> <s>They were nice guys, especially Tichener.</s> <s>It was just before dinner and it was !</s> <s>ting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway.</s> <s>It kept !</s> <s>ting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing.</s> <s>Finally we had to.</s> <s>This teacher that taught biology, Mr Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and !</s> <s> ready for dinner.</s> <s>If I !</s> <s> a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can !</s> <s> a good-by when I need one - at least, most of the time I can.</s> <s>As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's house.</s> <s>He didn't live on the campus.</s> <s>He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.</s></p>
<p><s>I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath.</s> <s>I have no wind, if you want to know the truth.</s> <s>I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing — that is, I used to be.</s> <s>They made me cut it out.</s> <s>Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year.</s> <s>That's also how I practically got t.b.</s> <s>and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff.</s> <s>I'm pretty healthy, though.</s></p>
<p><s>Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 2.04.</s> <s>It was icy as hell and I damn near fell down.</s> <s>I don't even know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it.</s> <s>After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.</s> <s>It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.</s></p>
<p><s>Boy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house.</s></p>
<p><s>I was really frozen.</s> <s>My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all.</s> <s>'C'mon, c'mon,' I said right out loud, almost, 'somebody open the door.'</s> <s>Finally old Mrs Spencer opened it.</s> <s>They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves.</s> <s>They didn't have too much dough.</s></p>
<p><s>'Holden!' Mrs Spencer said.</s> <s>'How lovely to see you!</s> <s>Come in, dear!</s> <s>Are you frozen to death?'</s> <s>I think she was glad to see me.</s> <s>She liked me.</s> <s>At least, I think she did.</s></p>
<p><s>Boy, did I !</s> <s> in that house fast.</s> <s>'How are you, Mrs Spencer?'</s> <s>I said.</s> <s>'How's Mr Spencer?'</s></p>
<p>'Let me take your coat, dear,' she said.</s> <s>She didn't hear me ask her how Mr Spencer was.</s> <s>She was sort of deaf.</s></p>
<p><s>She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand.</s> <s>I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much.</s> <s>'How've you been, Mrs Spencer?'</s> <s>I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me.</s></p>
<p><s>'I've been just fine, Holden.'</s> <s>She closed the closet door 'How have you been?'</s> <s>The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked out, 'Fine,' I said.</s> <s>'How's Mr Spencer?</s> <s>He over his grippe yet?'</p>
<p><s>'Over it!</s> <s>Holden, he's behaving like a perfect - I don't know what...</s> <s>He's in his room, dear.</s> <s>Go right in.'</s></p>
<T Stout>
<p><s>When the doorbell rings while Nero Wolfe and I are at dinner, in the old brownstone house on West Thirty-fifth Street, ordinarily it is left to Fritz to answer it.</s> <s>But that evening I went myself, knowing that Fritz was in no mood to handle a caller, no matter who it was.</s></p>
<p><s>Fritz's mood should be explained.</s> <s>Each year around the middle of May, by arrangement, a farmer who lives up near Brewster shoots eighteen or twenty starlings, puts them in a hag, and gets in his car and drives to New York.</s> <s>It is understood that they are to be delivered to our door within two hours after they were winged.</s> <s>Fritz dresses them and sprinkles them with salt, and, at the proper moment, brushes them with melted butter, wraps them in sage leaves, grills them, and arranges them on a platter of hot polenta, which is thick porridge of fine-ground yellow cornmeal with butter, grated cheese, and salt and pepper.</s></p>
<p><s>It is an expensive meal and a happy one, and Wolfe always looks forward to it, but that day he put on an exhibition.</s> <s>When the platter was brought in, steaming, and placed before him, he sniffed, ducked his head and sniffed again, and straightened to look up at Fritz.</s></p>
<p><s>"The sage?"</s></p>
<p><s>"No, sir."</s></p>
<p><s>"What do you mean, no, sir?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I thought you might like it once in a style I have suggested, with saffron and tarragon.</s> <s>Much fresh tarragon, with just a touch of saffron, which is the way—"</p>
<p><s>"Remove it!"</s></p>
<p><s>Fritz went rigid and his lips tightened.</s></p>
<p><s>"You did not consult me," Wolfe said coldly.</s> <s>"To find that without warning one of my favorite dishes has been radically altered is an unpleasant shock.</s> <s>It may possibly be edible, but I am in no humor to risk it.</s> <s>Please dispose of it and bring me four coddled eggs and a piece of toast."</s></p>
<p><s>Fritz, knowing Wolfe as well as I did, aware that this was a stroke of discipline that hurt Wolfe more than it did him and that it would be useless to try to parley, reached for the platter, but I put in, "I'll take some if you don't mind.</s> <s>If the smell won't keep you from enjoying your eggs?"</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe glared at me.</s></p>
<p><s>That was how Fritz acquired the mood that made me think it advisable for me to answer the door.</s> <s>When the bell rang Wolfe had finished his eggs and was drinking coffee, really a pitiful sight, and I was toward the end of a second helping of the starlings and polenta, which was certainly edible.</s> <s>Going to the hall and the front, I didn't bother to snap the light switch because there was still enough twilight for me to see, through the one-way glass panel, that the customer on the stoop was not our ship coming in.</s></p>
<p><s>I pulled the door open and told him politely, "Wrong number."</s></p>
<p><s>I was polite by policy, my established policy of promoting the idea of peace on earth with the neighborhood kids.</s> <s>It made life smoother in that street, where there was a fair amount of ball throwing and other activities.</s></p>
<p><s>"Guess again," he told me in a low nervous alto, not too rude.</s> <s>"You're Archie Goodwin.</s> <s>I've gotta see Nero Wolfe."</s></p>
<p><s>"What's your name?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Pete."</s></p>
<p><s>"What's the rest of it?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Drossos.</s> <s>Pete Drossos."</s></p>
<p><s>"What do you want to sec Mr. Wolfe about?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I gotta case.</s> <s>I'll tell him."</s></p>
<p><s>He was a wiry little specimen with black hair that needed a trim and sharp black eyes, the top of his head coming about level with the knot of my four-in-hand.</s> <s>I had seen him around the neighborhood but had nothing either for or against him.</s> <s>The thing was to ease him off without starting a feud, and ordinarily I would have gone at it, but after Wolfe's childish performance with Fritz I thought it would do him good to have another child to play with.</s> <s>Naturally he would snarl and snap, but if Pete got scratched I could salve him afterward.</s> <s>So I invited him in and escorted him to the dining room.</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe was refilling his coffee cup.</s> <s>He shot a glance at Pete, who I admit was not dressed up, put the pot down, looked straight at me, and spoke.</s></p>
<p><s>"Archie.</s> <s>I will not have interruptions at meals."</s></p>
<p><s>I nodded sympathetically.</s> <s>"I know, but this wasn't a meal.</s> <s>Call eggs a meal?</s> <s>This is Mr. Peter Drossos.</s> <s>He wants to consult you about a case.</s> <s>I was going to tell him you're busy, but I remembered you got sore because Fritz didn't consult you, and I didn't want you to get sore at Pete too.</s> <s>He's a neighbor of ours, and you know, love thy neighbor as thyself."</s></p>
<p><s>Ragging Wolfe is always a gamble.</s> <s>A quick reflex explosion may split the air, but if it doesn't, if he takes a second for a look at it, you're apt to find yourself topped.</s> <s>That time he took several seconds, sipping coffee, and then addressed our caller courteously.</s> <s>"Sit down, Mr. Drossos."</s></p>
<p><s>"I'm not mister, I'm Pete."</s></p>
<p><s>"Very well, Pete, sit down.</s> <s>Turn more to face me, please.</s> <s>Thank you.</s> <s>You wish to consult me?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yeah, I gotta case."</s></p>
<p><s>"I always welcome a case, but the timing is a little unfortunate because Mr. Goodwin was going out this evening to see a billiard match, and now of course he will have to stay here to take down all that you say and all that I say.</s> <s>Archie, get your notebook, please?"</s></p>
<p><s>As I said, it's always a gamble.</s> <s>He had his thumb in my eye.</s> <s>I went across the hall to the office for a notebook and pen, and when I returned Fritz was there with coffee for me and cookies and a bottle of Coke for Pete.</s> <s>I said nothing.</s> <s>My pen and notebook would do the recording almost automatically, needing about a fifth of my brain, and I would see the rest of it devising plans for getting from under.</s></p>
<p><s>Pete was talking.</s> <s>"I guess it's okay him taking it down, but I gotta watch my end.</s> <s>This is strictly under the lid."</s></p>
<p><s>"If you mean it's confidential, certainly."</s></p>
<p><s>"Then I'll spill it.</s> <s>I know there's some private eyes you can't open up to, but you're different.</s> <s>We know all about you around here.</s> <s>I know how you feel about the lousy cops, just like I do.</s> <s>So I'll lay it out."</s></p>
<p><s>"Please do."</s></p>
<p><s>"Okay.</s> <s>What time is it?"</s></p>
<p><s>I looked at my wrist watch.</s> <s>"Ten to eight."</s></p>
<p><s>"Then it happened an hour ago.</s> <s>I know sometimes everything hangs on the time element, and right after it happened I went and looked at the clock in the drugstore near the corner, and it was a quarter to seven.</s> <s>I was working the wipe racket there at the corner of Thirty-fifth and Ninth, and a Caddy stopped—"</p>
<p><s>"Please.</s> <s>What's the wipe racket?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Why, you know, a car stops for the light and you hop to it with a rag and start wiping the window, and if it's a man and he lets you go on to the windshield you've got him for at least a dime.</s> <s>If it's a woman and she lets you go on, maybe you've got her and maybe not.</s> <s>That's a chance you take.</s> <s>Well, this Caddy stopped—"</p>
<p><s>"What's a Caddy?"</s></p>
<p><s>From the look that appeared in the sharp black eyes, Pete was beginning to suspect that he had picked the wrong private eye.</s> <s>I cut in to show him that anyhow one of us wasn't a moron, telling Wolfe, "A Cadillac automobile."</s></p>
<p><s>"I see.</s> <s>It stopped?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yeah, for the light.</s> <s>I went for the window by the driver.</s> <s>It was a woman.</s> <s>She turned her face around to me to look straight at me and she said something.</s> <s>I don't think she made any sound, or anyway if she did I didn't hear anything through the window because it was up nearly to the top, but she worked her lips with it and I could tell what it was.</s> <s>She said, 'Help.</s> <s>Get a cop.'</s> <s>Like this, look."</s></p>
<p><s>He reached in his pants pocket, pulled out a little scrap of paper, and read from it: "Connecticut, Y,Y, nine, four, three, two."</s></p>
<p><s>"Excellent."</s> <s>Wolfe returned his empty cup to the saucer.</s> <s>"Have you given that to the police?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Me?"</s> <s>Pete was scornful.</s> <s>"The cops?</s> <s>Look, am I screwy?</s> <s>I go to the precinct and tell a flattie, or even say I get to a sarge and tell him, and what?</s> <s>First he don't believe me and then he chases me and then I'm marked.</s> <s>It don't hurt you to be marked, because you're a private eye with a license and you've got something on a lot of inspectors."</s></p>
<p><s>"I have?</s> <s>What?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Don't ask me.</s> <s>But everybody knows you're loaded with dirt on some big boys or you'd have been rubbed out long ago.</s> <s>But a kid like me can't risk it to be marked even if I'm straight.</s> <s>I hate cops, but you don't have to be a crook to hate cops.</s> <s>I keep telling my mother I'm straight, and I am straight, but I'm telling you it takes a lot of guts.</s> <s>What do you think of this case I got?"</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe considered.</s> <s>"It seems a little—uh—hazy."</s></p>
<p><s>"Yeah, that's why I came to you.</s> <s>I went to a place I go to when I want to think, and I went all over it.</s> <s>I saw it was a swell case if I handled it right.</s> <s>The car was a Caddy, a dark gray fifty-two Caddy.</s> <s>The man looked mean, but he looked like dough, he looked like he might have two or three more Caddies.</s> <s>The woman did too.</s> <s>She wasn't as old as my mother, but I guess I can't go by that because my mother has done a lot of hard work, and I bet she never did work.</s> <s>She had a scratch on her face, on her left cheek, and her face was all twisted saying that to me, 'Help, get a cop'; but, thinking it over, I decided she was a good-looker.</s> <s>She had big gold spiders for earrings, spiders with their legs stretched out.</s> <s>Pure gold."</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe grunted.</s></p>
<p><s>"Okay," Pete conceded, "they looked like gold.</s> <s>They wasn't brass.</s> <s>Anyhow, the whole layout said dough, and what I was thinking went like this: I got a case with people with dough, and how do I handle it so I'll get some?</s> <s>There might be up to fifty dollars in it if I handle it right.</s> <s>If he kills her I can identify him and get the reward.</s> <s>I can tell what she said to me and how he jabbed the gun in her—"</p>
<p><s>"You didn't see a gun."</s></p>
<p><s>"That's a detail.</s> <s>If he didn't kill her, if he just made her do something or tell him something or give him something, I can go and put it up to him, either he comes across with fifty bucks, or maybe a hundred, or I hang it on him."</s></p>
<p><s>"That would be blackmail."</s></p>
<p><s>"Okay."</s> <s>Pete brushed cookie crumbs from his fingers onto the tray.</s> <s>"That's why I decided I had to see you after I thought it over.</s> <s>I saw I couldn't handle it alone and I'd have to cut you in, but you understand it's my case.</s> <s>Maybe you think I was a sap to tell you that license number before we made a deal, but I don't.</s> <s>If you get onto him and comer him and try to cross me and hog it, I'll still have to identify him, so it will be up to me.</s> <s>If blackmail's out, you can figure it so it's not blackmail.</s> <s>What do you say we split fifty-fifty?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I'll tell you, Pete."</s> <s>Wolfe pushed his chair back and got his bulk comfortably settled in a new position.</s> <s>"If we are to join hands on your case I think I should tell you a few things about the science and art of detection.</s> <s>Mr. Goodwin will of course take it down, and when he types it he will make a copy for you.</s> <s>But first he'll make a phone call.</s> <s>Archie, you have that license number.</s> <s>Call Mr. Cramer's office and give them that number.</s> <s>Say that you have information that that car, or its owner or operator, may have been involved in a violation of a law in this city in the past two hours, and suggest a routine check.</s> <s>Do not be more definite.</s> <s>Say that our information is unverified and inquiry should be discreet."</s></p>
<p><s>"Hey," Pete demanded, "who's Mr. Cramer?</s> <s>A cop?"</s></p>
<p><s>"A police inspector," Wolfe told him.</s> <s>"You yourself suggested the possibility of murder.</s> <s>If there was a murder there is a corpse.</s> <s>If there is a corpse it should be found.</s> <s>Unless and until it is found, where's your case?</s> <s>We have no idea where to look for it, so we'll trick the police into finding it for us.</s> <s>I often make use of them that way.</s> <s>Archie.</s> <s>Of course you will not mention Pete's name, since he doesn't want to be marked."</s></p>
<p><s>As I went across to the office, to my desk, and dialed the number of Manhattan Homicide West, I was reflecting that of all Wolfe's thousand techniques for making himself obnoxious the worst was when he thought he was being funny.</s> <s>When I finished talking to Sergeant Purlcy Stebbins and hung up, I was tempted to just walk out and go up to watch Mosconi and Watrous handle their cues, but of course that wouldn't do because it would have been admitting he had called me good, and he would merely have shooed Pete out and settled down with a book and a satisfied smirk.</s></p>
<p><s>So I marched back to the dining room, sat down and took up my pen, and said brightly, "All right, they're alerted.</s> <s>Shoot the lecture on detection, and don't leave anything out."</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe leaned back, put his elbows on the chair arms, and matched his fingertips.</s> <s>"You understand, Pete, that I shall confine myself to the problems and methods of the private detective who works at his profession for a living."</s></p>
