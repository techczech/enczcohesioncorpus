<p><s>On their employer's estate, Mr Nykles was the farm-steward and Mr Paser the squire's secretary, and they were extremely good friends.</s> <s>Day after day they would sit in the village inn, a vast rustic hostelry run by Mr Tiska, where they were regarded as so inseparable that whenever there was a rumpus in the village you could stake your life that it would automatically be attributed to them both.</s> <s>Steward Nykles was very fond of secretary Paser, yet there lay between them one terrible thing which occasion-ally brought an expression of despondency to Nykles's face.</s> <s>And that one thing was so unparal-leled that it would make steward Nykles fret as only a truly kind soul knows how.</s> <s>For whenever these two had been sitting in Tiska's tavern drinking to-gether and ended up carrying out one of their merry japes, which usually amounted to grabbing the village bobby and tossing him into a ditch some-where, the consensus that ran through the village next day was that 'last night steward Nykles got pissed as a newt and secretary Paser was a bit tipsy.'</s></p>
<p><s>Yet there was no question that both had been equally inebriated, they had drunk the same amount, and it had had the same effect on their brains, yet there was no helping it: the popular view was: 'Steward Nykles got pissed as a newt and secretary Paser was a bit tipsy.'</s></p>
<p><s>So it comes as no surprise that it was steward Nykles's profoundest wish to see things turned around, so when what folk were saying really got to him, he began to be more abstemious, and while secretary Paser got through three pints, he had one, so by the time the secretary had drunk 30 pints, he'd only had 10.</s> <s>Giving a proper ratio of 3:1, and that day they didn't get up to any of their tricks.</s> <s>Nykles helped Paser walk straight, and the withdrawn, thoughtful secretary ranted and raved through the village, swearing at the innkeeper, while Nykles maintained an unusually decent demeanour; yet next day he again heard what Tiska had been telling people in answer to the question how long they'd stayed boozing: 'Oh, you know, steward Nykles got pissed as a newt and secretary Paser was a bit tipsy.'</s></p>
<p><s>Nykles realised that what was going on here was the effect of social oppositions, a huge social gulf that meant it was inconceivable that he, a farm-steward, could ever be the equal of a squire's secretary, and gradually he yearned for the day when it would be said that:</s></p>
<p><s>'Ah yes, the steward was a bit tipsy and the secretary was pissed as a newt.'</s></p>
<p><s>But his wish was never fulfilled.</s> <s>What folk were used to saying they just carried on saying, out of deference to the secretary, no matter how little he drank.</s> <s>Whenever they were returning on the half-hour walk back to the estate, Nykles would even hear Paser utter that cruel word which always made him so depressed: 'Got myself a bit tipsy again, eh?'</p>
<p><s>So finally steward Nykles went with the flow and knew that even if they were just as drunk as one another, he would only ever be as pissed as a newt and secretary Paser a bit tipsy.</s></p>
<p><s>Paser might be hardly able to stand, and he, Nykles, might walk beside him erect, yet the secretary was only ever a bit tipsy and he was inevitably 'pissed'.</s></p>
<p><s>It came to pass one day that they were both equally drunk, and, as the saying went, all set to keel over.</s> <s>Nykles had been drinking knowing there was nothing for it, while Mr Paser had been quite frivolous, safe in the knowledge of his good reputation.</s> <s>Then they had gone out into the village and in a drunken stupor had pushed a uniformed personage into the duckpond.</s> <s>It was just one of their ordinary tricks, in return for which the secretary would buy the village constable a pint and a cigar every evening.</s> <s>It is said that no one can escape his destiny – and nor did they.</s> <s>It hadn't been the village constable, but an inspector.</s> <s>An inspector doing the rounds, an inspector who is protected under paragraph 81 of the criminal code, which is quite explicit as to the assault committed by anyone who lays a finger on a public official.</s></p>
<p><s>From that moment the spectre of prison hung over both of them.</s> <s>It was a case for the county court.</s> <s>The local magistrates court wasn't up to it.</s> <s>And so both thugs were sent for trial at the county court in Ji?ín.</s> <s>Both pleaded drunkenness, and both called the innkeeper, the mayor and three farmers as witnesses who had been around that evening when each of them had downed thirty pints.</s></p>
<p><s>The first witness was Tiska, the innkeeper.</s> <s>'Well,' said the judge, 'how was it with Mr Nykles.</s> <s>What was his condition when he left your establishment?'</p>
<p><s>'If you please, yer 'onour,' said Tiska solemnly, 'Mr Nykles (ere, well, as God is my witness, (e were pissed as a newt, m'lud.'</s></p>
<p><s>'And what about Mr Paser, Mr Tiska?'</p>
<p><s>The innkeeper looked respectfully towards the secretary and pronounced with warmth: 'Secretary Paser, m'lud, (e were tipsy.' And so it was entered in the record.</s> <s>Then came the other witnesses and replied in like manner: 'The steward was pissed as a newt, but the secretary was a bit tipsy.'</p>
<p><s>The case was quite clear and the verdict was brought in accordingly.</s> <s>Since secretary Paser had merely been 'tipsy', he got one month, but Nykles, who had been pissed as a newt, was discharged on the grounds of diminished responsibility.</s> <s>And steward Nykles had one extra satisfaction, for, after the verdict was announced, secretary Paser cried out in desperation: 'In the name of God, my lord, I was pissed as a newt as well!'</p>
<p><s>But it made no difference.</s></p>

<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>While I dislike all the comparisons and parables with which Doctor Vlach habitually lards his spirited discourse, I do recognise that his telling parable of the café, mankind and a bowl of doughnuts is not without merit.</s> <s>For it permits me to demonstrate, at least up to a point, what manner of man Saturnin is.</s></p>
<p><s>You have to appreciate that Doctor Vlach classifies people according to their behaviour in a half-deserted café when faced with a bowl of doughnuts.</s> <s>Imagine a high-class café on a Sunday morning.</s> <s>It's a glorious sunny day and there are very few customers inside.</s> <s>You've taken breakfast, read all the newspapers and now you are lounging comfortably in a well-upholstered alcove, gazing thoughtfully at a bowl full of doughnuts.</s> <s>Tedium gradually filters into every corner of the café.</s></p>
<p><s>According to the Vlach theory, it is at this point that your affinity with this or that group of people emerges.</s> <s>If you are a person lacking in imagination, energy and a sense of humour, you will gaze at the doughnuts in mute passivity until noon, when you will rise and go for lunch.</s></p>
<p><s>I have reason to believe that, according to Doctor Vlach, this category includes myself.</s> <s>I also believe he is wrong.</s> <s>We need say nothing of humour or energy, but the fact that he denies me any imagination when he knows full well that I have succeeded in filling in my income tax and national insurance forms to perfection really does surprise one.</s> <s>But never mind.</s> <s>Even if I did belong to that group, I would find it more palatable than being a member of group two, which allegedly whiles the time away imagining what would happen if, out of the blue and without warning, someone started pelting the other customers with the doughnuts.</s></p>
<p><s>I fail to understand how an intelligent adult can think of such things.</s> <s>Yet I concur entirely with Doctor Vlach's view of himself as one who does belong to the latter category.</s> <s>And for some unfathomable reason is proud of the fact!</s> <s>He views such people as intellectually more mature.</s> <s>For my own part, I am mystified as to what unites intellectual maturity and the image of doughnuts splattering on the heads of innocent coffee-drinkers.</s> <s>It's beyond me, but so be it; let's not argue about it.</s> <s>I have 0 an unshakeable view of debates with Doctor Vlach, for whenever I have entered upon one I have inevitably had the feeling of one who has been crazy enough to batter a hole in the retaining wall of a high dam using only his head.</s></p>
<p><s>Now, if Fate had not brought Saturnin my way, I might never have believed that there are also persons of a third category, rare though they be.</s> <s>By these I mean people who are so seduced by the image of doughnuts whizzing through the air that they get up and make the image a reality.</s></p>
<p><s>Doctor Vlach holds such individuals in the highest regard.</s> <s>It is his contention that such an act calls not only for a finely tuned sense of the comic, but also for courage, spirit and goodness knows what else.</s> <s>My own view is that it calls for such an extraordinary dose of folly that any sensible being must be seized with amazement that such people are also to be encountered outside the walls of those institutions which human society has erected for them.</s> <s>It has been my misfortune to have acquired first-hand experience of the existence of such people and to have learned that their personal liberty is in no wise constrained.</s> <s>For Saturnin is indeed one of them.</s></p>
<p><s>Today, if I look back over that recent short period of my life, I am left wondering at many things.</s> <s>Such as the sheer number of events that occurred during it.</s> <s>My life became oddly condensed, with events hurtling along one after another so fast that I could barely keep track of them.</s> <s>I felt like one who, descending a snow-covered slope, had stepped on ice concealed beneath the snow.</s> <s>And I have an uncanny feeling that as I slithered downwards, as smoothly as over a pane of glass, my behaviour was not entirely what you would call dignified.</s> <s>That is, I believe, understandable, and I'd like to meet anyone who might hold it against me.</s> <s>The good advice that I could have stepped sideways off the slippery slope at any time could only come from one who has no idea what it is like to be wrestling with the last remnant of equilibrium.</s> <s>But as it happens, it wasn't an entirely unpleasant experience either, and I might go so far as to say that it was worth it.</s> <s>It may be a long time since I grew out of my childhood dreams of adventure and now prefer a life of peaceful sobriety; on the other hand, a dash or two of the extraordinary never did anyone any harm.</s> <s>No one has yet drowned in the rain, and unpleasantnesses are soon forgotten.</s> <s>With hindsight, a fraught trek through a blizzard may seem a quite an interesting adventure.</s></p>
<p><s>It was perhaps not sensible for me, a single and fairly young man, to take on a manservant.</s> <s>It may appear a little eccentric or too much like something out of a novel.</s> <s>What is, however, certain is that you will find very few young men in Bohemia who have their own manservant, and my gentle, conservative nature finds the memory of having done something so unusual somewhat vexatious.</s></p>
<p><s>Saturnin had been advertising in the press for a position under conditions which I was able to accept, and he had several excellent references.</s> <s>His appearance and bearing comme il faut appealed to me.</s> <s>I was to learn later that he had had a thorough and systematic education.</s> <s>His name, a rather unusual one, was vaguely familiar, but I have only recently discovered the association which had stuck in my memory: I happened across a newspaper from about two years previously with an article in it about an attempted burglary at the villa of a Professor Luda, and I remembered that we had actually talked about it at the time in the café.</s> <s>Saturnin had been the hero of the hour and the newspaper's more earnest readers had been not a little baffled by his actions.</s> <s>But anyway, here's the cutting concerned:</s></p>
<p><s>HAIR-RAISING INCIDENT WITH A BURGLAR.</s> <s>During the hours of darkness on Sunday morning, 6th August, an unknown burglar entered the villa of the collector, Professor Luda, and attemp-ted to break into the safe in which the professor kept a number of valuable gold antiques.</s> <s>Before he could open it he was disturbed by a member of the domestic staff, a Mr Saturnin.</s> <s>What then ensued between the two men is being investigated.</s> <s>Someone had telephoned for the police.</s> <s>When they arrived on the scene they found the burglar unconscious and with a deep gash in his head.</s> <s>Mr Saturnin's testi-mony was rather unusual: he claimed that the burglar's injury was self-inflicted, caused by a flail from the professor's collection of medieval weapons.</s> <s>He has stubbornly stood by this strange statement.</s> <s>The burglar came round in hospital 0 and claims to have forgotten his name.</s> <s>The pre-liminary investigation suggests the following sequence of events:</s></p>
<p><s>having been disturbed, the burglar tried to intimidate Mr Saturnin with a loaded revolver; Mr Saturnin took the revolver from him and threw it out of the window into the garden, where it was found subsequently.</s> <s>Then Mr Saturnin seems to have harangued the burglar on the unfairness of a fight between unequally armed contestants.</s> <s>He made him take down from the wall a weapon which the burglar describes as a stick with ball and chain on the end, and he, Saturnin, availed himself of another.</s> <s>After some confused preliminaries, battle was joined during which the burglar sustained his injury.</s> <s>Interest-ingly, the burglar concedes that he could have caused his injury himself.</s> <s>He says that the weapon was tricky to handle and several times he had been lucky to dodge the swirling ball of his own weapon.</s> <s>He also says that throughout the fight he had been afraid of breaking the chandelier.</s> <s>All in all, he was glad things ended as they had.</s> <s>Once the investigation is completed we will report it in full.</s></p>
<p><s>I have already said that you cannot have a discussion about anything with Doctor Vlach.</s> <s>Not only does he overwhelm you with a torrent of words worthy of a costermongter, he also usually manages some fantastic verbal somersault and launches into a fiery tirade against something you never intended to discuss in the first place.</s> <s>In due course, this circumstance will affect the continuity of my narrative, but I can do nothing about that.</s> <s>Doctor Vlach's unexpected perorations sometimes mean that a chapter that opens with a treatise on criminology may well end with a treatise on criminology though most of the intervening discourse will have been taken up with trout fishing.</s> <s>That's just the way Doctor Vlach is, and at fifty he is simply not amenable to reconstruction.</s></p>
<p><s>When I once asked him what a common-sense individual is to make of the event described in that newspaper cutting, his reply was that it was extremely hard to say, since these days there are no common-sense people left.</s> <s>He said that we all harness our brains to our own particular narrowly specialised professions and then do our damnedest to ensure that the rest of our little grey cells atrophy.</s> <s>As soon as that happens, our lords and masters begin to take note of us and we are launched on our respective careers.</s> <s>He finds it amazing that in this day and age the simplest considerations are beyond the intellectual horizons of most people.</s></p>
<p><s>Doctor Vlach went on for another hour and a quarter and while I cannot now recollect what it was all about, I do know that he ended by praising Pythagoras.</s> <s>I made no attempt to refute his opinion of the latter, but as for his allegation that these days no one has any common sense, I believe he should speak for himself only.</s></p>
<C Chapter 2>
<p><s>I would like you to imagine how peaceful my life had been before Saturnin became my gentleman's gentleman.</s> <s>I used to inhabit a modest apartment in one of those old town-houses which always held a unique charm for me.</s> <s>I felt extremely contented in it.</s> <s>The atmosphere of these houses, with their richly stucco'd fa(ades, their worn stone stairways, the intimate twilight of their corridors and their high pannelled doors, appealed to my soul far, far more than the uniform environment of more modern buildings.</s> <s>I have a sort of sense that a pleasant, reassuring half-light is a necessary attribute of a truly cosy human dwelling.</s></p>
<p><s>Doctor Vlach maintains that these are feelings which I have inherited from my cave-dwelling ancestors.</s> <s>At the time, his stated views of my accommodation were generally disparaging.</s> <s>He could not understand how I could live there.</s> <s>He used to say that as he entered it his heart would feel constricted and his soul would fill with distressing images of human tragedy.</s> <s>All who had lived there over the years had borne their joys away with them, leaving behind their pain, grief and despair.</s> <s>He insisted that the house's walls were saturated with tears shed during hapless nights after which no day had dawned.</s> <s>In short, Doctor Vlach would say that terrible things must have happened there and that depression would always descend upon him within its walls.</s></p>
<p><s>To the best of my own knowledge, nothing terrible ever did happen there, apart from the occasion when some scaffolding collapsed, not, however, on Doctor Vlach, but down into the yard.</s> <s>Nobody had been injured, so there was no reason for anyone to be particularly disconsolate.</s> <s>Doctor Vlach's response to that was that it was better for depression to descend upon him than for him to be descended upon by scaffolding.</s> <s>Thus would he sidestep any serious discussion.</s></p>
<p><s>So: I used to live in a small, quiet apartment, whose walls were adorned with faded wallpaper and pictures in heavy, old-fashioned frames.</s> <s>A grandfather-clock with mechanical chimes marked the passage of time during the languorous evenings which I would spend in my huge winged armchair.</s></p>
<p><s>Yes, I spend quite a lot of time indoors, especially if the weather outside is inclement.</s> <s>During the dark nights of winter, when the heavens hurl torrents of rain down to earth, the cold wind wrenches the leaves from the trees and howls about the towers of ancient castles, mingling with the cries of frightened crows, when lone horsemen gallop along muddy roads on their dubious missions..., on nights like that I would spend many a long hour by the fire reading gothic novels.</s> <s>Then I would retire to bed and dream that I could hear the weeping of my beloved, the crackling of burning roof-timbers and oaths swearing vengeance, and, come the morning, I would be amazed to find that electric trams plied the streets of Prague.</s> <s>I would be surprised to find that the coffee which Mrs Suchánková brought in for my breakfast was not poisoned.</s></p>
<p><s>Mrs Suchánková was an elderly lady with black hair, neatly parted, who looked after me with a quite maternal solicitude.</s> <s>I wanted for nothing, I had no cause for complaint, and that might well be what irked me deep down.</s> <s>There is a proverb for this state of affairs, but I avoid proverbs and sayings on principle.</s> <s>I find them heartily abhorrent.</s> <s>When you meet my aunt Katherine you'll understand why.</s></p>
<p><s>One day, then, this peaceful milieu was invaded by Saturnin, whose mission in life was to make mine as turbulent as possible.</s> <s>In this he did not fail, as you will see.</s></p>
<p><s>Let me make myself clear: I emphatically do not mean that Saturnin was not a good manservant.</s> <s>He enjoyed all the qualities a good manservant should have.</s> <s>He was handsome, fair-haired, honest, dependable and highly intelligent.</s> <s>It is my abiding impression that he might just as easily have been the managing director of a multinational company as a gentleman's gentleman.</s> <s>With the obvious difference, however, that he could not have kept switching managerial posts the way he did switch the gentlemen he served.</s></p>
<p><s>When he presented his papers, I could not fail to remark that there was no testimonial from his most recent employer.</s> <s>Later I learned why he couldn't have had one.</s> <s>He had left that post after an almost absurd scene: just when he thought that he could no longer endure the ways of the lady who employed him, he was seized by the oddest frenzy.</s> <s>In a fury which I have reason to doubt was feigned, he wreaked inexcusable damage to the furnishings, tossed his surprised employer into the fountain in the garden of her grand house, and only then calmed down.</s> <s>I refrain from naming the lady concerned, though I know her very well, and it has to be said that my own experience of her renders Saturnin's actions understandable, if not excusable.</s> <s>By which I mean that I can think of a large number of people who would have gladly tossed her into the fountain themselves.</s> <s>However, not one of them would have rounded the scene off in the manner selected by Saturnin.</s> <s>For when the lady surfaced to stand waist-deep in the water and fix the culprit with an utterly bemused stare, he bowed stiffly and announced that dinner was served.</s> <s>Then he withdrew to pack his belongings.</s></p>
<p><s>It was only much later that I understood that the engineering of such nonsensical situations is a major passion of his.</s> <s>Not that he would take any such liberties against my person.</s> <s>For one thing, my bodily proportions are adequate to convince him that any given situation might not work out quite as he might intend, and for another, he is restrained by my natural dignity.</s> <s>None the less, ever since he became my manservant, not a day has passed, not an hour has passed, when I have not known whether I might not have to unravel some or other unprecedented, sensational and usually pretty parlous predicament.</s></p>
<p><s>It began when he was talking to Mrs Suchánková about me, allegedly according me such fantastic titles as sir, His Grace, sahib or His Excellency – according to what he happened to have been reading.</s> <s>Then he imported into my apartment sundry hunting trophies, such as buffalo heads, elephant tusks, animal skins and the like; later, I discovered that he'd borrowed them from the props department of our leading theatre.</s> <s>Behind my back he must have regaled my friends with some fantastic yarns, since how else could I explain the request by a number of ladies of my acquaintance to recount how I had once killed a shark with the tripod of my camera.</s> <s>I naturally denied that I had ever done anything of the kind, and ever since I have enjoyed the reputation of an oh-so-modest hero.</s></p>
<p><s>I have pondered in vain why Saturnin does these things.</s> <s>At first I put it down to a manic yearning to become the manservant of a gentleman-adventurer and the consequent need to swathe my prosaic being in an aura of heroism.</s> <s>Later I concluded that he did it just for fun.</s> <s>His sense of humour was generally of a disreputable order.</s> <s>He treated me once to a garbled disquisition on the subject of the jokes we call practical.</s> <s>If I understood him right, a good practical joke culminates in either a conflagration or serious physical injury.</s> <s>I cannot claim to share his enthusiasm.</s></p>
<p><s>After about six months, Saturnin began to intimate that the apartment in which we had lived quite happily until then was not large enough.</s> <s>Broadly speaking he was right.</s> <s>Originally it had been totally adequate, but if any of you has ever seen buffalo horns...</s> <s>but that would be a long story.</s> <s>It goes without saying that Doctor Vlach egged Saturnin on.</s> <s>He said that I should have moved out long ago, adding something about my delicate constitution and damp walls.</s> <s>There was not an ounce of truth in this.</s> <s>The apartment was not damp in the slightest, and where my health was concerned, Doctor Vlach knew absolutely nothing.</s> <s>The last time he had examined me was when I had measles, at the age of ten or thereabouts.</s></p>
<p><s>The matter was concluded one afternoon when Saturnin sought me out in the circle of my friends and discreetly informed me that we had moved house.</s> <s>He added that we now lived on the waterside, close to the Chain Bridge.</s></p>
<p><s>It would presumably have suited him best if I had fainted.</s> <s>Instead, I remained utterly calm and went on with my game of cards.</s> <s>Only that evening, after a number of brandies, did I go to have a look at the old apartment.</s> <s>It really was empty and Mrs Suchánková's eyes were red from crying.</s> <s>From the manner in which the landlord treated me I concluded that it would be wisest not to pursue the details of the removal.</s></p>
<p><s>Then I went to the Chain Bridge.</s> <s>There wasn't much point, but then I had to go somewhere.</s> <s>Saturnin was standing on the embankment.</s> <s>He was wearing a flat sailor-hat and called me Captain.</s></p>
<p><s>Since that time we have lived aboard a house-boat, and I cannot claim that it is all that bad.</s> <s>It is true that in the very first week our mooring failed in the night and our boat floated off and went over a weir.</s> <s>Not a pleasant occurrence.</s> <s>It was pitch dark and initially I assumed that Saturnin had drowned, since I looked for him all over the boat in vain.</s> <s>It later transpired that he had slept through it all in the crow's nest.</s> <s>But apart from this disturbing incident, I could not, as I have said, complain about my new accommodation.</s> <s>One has to make all sorts of accommodations with life.</s></p>
<p><s>This does not mean that I simply gave in to all Saturnin's ideas out of resignation.</s> <s>One reason I could not do so was that I had to think of my reputation, which had been seriously dented thanks to his crazy doings: I began to be viewed as a man of great courage, if rather eccentric.</s> <s>Something like Harry Piel.</s> <s>In a passing reference to our house-boat in the newspaper my name was preceded by the words 'that great Czech sportsman'.</s> <s>The next day I overheard a conversation between Saturnin and the coalman, in which the former, in considerable agitation, was complaining that it had not said 'big-game hunter', though he had been at great pains to get this across to the editor.</s></p>
<p><s>My burgeoning, undeserved, not to say unwelcome reputation as an exceptional individual began to have some most unfortunate consequences.</s> <s>Thus one night, for example, I was woken by a man in a peaked hat who explained that my assistance was urgently required.</s> <s>Applying considerable reserves of my deductive powers I eventually gathered from the man's confused account that a certain inmate who thought he was Marcus Aurelius had escaped from the institution in whose care he had been placed and that the management of the institution was of the view that a for man of my extraordinary qualities it would be a trifling exercise to recapture him for them.</s></p>
<p><s>It comes hard to disabuse those who hold you in such high regard.</s> <s>I rose from my bed and quickly got dressed.</s> <s>The man in the peaked hat said that he had been instructed to ensure that I would be so kind as to bring a rifle with me.</s> <s>Since I do not possess one, I talked my way out of that.</s> <s>I said that I would not need one and the man in the peaked hat looked upon me with an expression of unfeigned reverence.</s></p>
<p><s>I gave Saturnin his instructions for the event that I should fail to return and went off with the man into the rain-soaked night.</s> <s>It was only from our conversation as we walked along that it transpired that he was a zoo-keeper, and that Marcus Aurelius was a lion.</s></p>
<p><s>I am definitely no coward, being a man of average courage, but you can imagine what I felt.</s> <s>I do not like to remember the occasion.</s> <s>In the end all ended well.</s> <s>The staff of the zoo had managed to catch the lion when it fell asleep, exhausted by repeated vain attempts to attack a No. 12 tram.</s> <s>My intervention was therefore not required, but the director of the zoo was nevertheless unstinting in his appreciation of my willingness to come to the rescue of the imperilled citizenry of Prague and held out the consoling prospect that next time I might be favoured by the opportunity to grab one of his wild beasts by the ears.</s> <s>He seemeds think that this was my secret longing.</s></p>
<p><s>Next day, my extraordinary zeal to participate in the recapture of poor Marcus Aurelius made it into the papers.</s> <s>You can imagine what grist this was to Saturnin's mill.</s></p>
<p><s>Talking of the event later to Doctor Vlach, I was almost insulted by his surprising interpretation.</s> <s>It struck him, he maintained, that the legend which Saturnin had built up around me must be rather to my liking.</s> <s>Otherwise he could not account for my willingness to go lion-hunting in the middle of the night.</s></p>
<p><s>I have always been of the opinion that the power to judge human character is a gift with which one is born.</s> <s>It cannot be acquired either with the passing years, or as a product of experience; the case of Doctor Vlach is proof of this.</s> <s>How could he imagine any such thing!</s> <s>Just how harebrained and conceited does he think I am?</s> <s>If I truly desired the reputation of an adventurer, I could go about acquiring it by my own efforts and not wait for a manservant to do it for me!</s> <s>Due allowance must be made for the fact that I have been placed in situations when I have had to strike a delicate balance between respect for the truth on the one hand and my self-respect on the other.</s></p>
<p><s>If you live the life of a normal sober citizen, your friends and acquaintances should have no grounds to ponder your likely response to being attacked by an enraged buffalo.</s> <s>Just try to imagine some of your own acquaintances in such a situation and you will see how pointless it is.</s> <s>In my case, though, you have to appreciate that thanks to Saturnin's cock-and-bull stories my own friends were seduced into those very musings.</s> <s>My personal courage was fictitiously put to sundry tests like a laboratory guinea-pig.</s></p>
<p><s>For example, that stupid story of the shark and the tripod was not of my making, but imagine how you would feel if the girl with the most beautiful lips you have ever seen curled them into a sceptical smirk and said: 'You, and a shark?'  It is then easily understood that some of my decisions have been underpinned by the desire to be able to say one day: 'Yes, Barbara, me and a shark, me and a lion, me and any danger, any time, any place.'</s></p>
<C Chapter 3>
<p><s>I made the acquaintance of Miss Barbara Tereba on a tennis court.</s> <s>She was the star of the suburban tennis club of which I was a member.</s> <s>I used to see her, gorgeous and inaccessible, having practice games with her trainer or some outstanding player.</s> <s>The fact that our acquaintanceship passed beyond my courteous good mornings and her courteous, if cool, replies is entirely due to Joe.</s></p>
<p><s>Permit me to introduce Joe.</s> <s>He is part of the club furniture, he is twelve, collects balls and forgotten rackets, smokes and plays truant.</s> <s>For all his young years, he passes for an expert judge of the beauty of female legs, the contours of which he studies closely during the exercise of his profession.</s> <s>His judgements are final, and it is a known fact that the possessor of the one pair of legs to stand up to his critical assessment is none other than Miss Barbara Tereba.</s></p>
<p><s>The male members of the club would laugh uproariously whenever Joe got on his hobby-horse in their company.</s> <s>For my part, I found this pastime extremely tasteless.</s> <s>Even ignoring Joe's scandalous lack of years, it remains beyond question that no man of breeding ogles ladies' legs.</s> <s>Even if the opportunity were granted.</s></p>
<p><s>Half an hour before I was introduced to Miss Barbara, I had been granted such an opportunity.</s> <s>I was sitting in a deck-chair outside the club-house and Miss Barbara was standing above me on the veranda.</s> <s>She was watching out for her trainer and kept glancing at her watch.</s> <s>My deck-chair was fitted with a sun-shade, which hid her from me from the waist up, so I could have easily inspected her legs without exposure to the risk of being caught in such a tactless course.</s></p>

<p><s>The woman in the office told me to go to the locker room: I was to wait there.</s> <s>So I set out across the court to a door which 0 bore the notice lockers.</s> <s>The office was grey and dismal, and so was the courtyard, with a pile of broken bricks and rubble in one corner, several two-wheeled handcarts, a lot of dustbins, and not a touch of greenery anywhere.</s> <s>The locker room seemed to me even more depressing: it was so dirty that, even had I not already known it, I would have guessed that this was a place where people changed who were supposed to look after our cleanliness.</s> <s>The cleanliness of our streets, of course, not the purity of our souls.</s> <s>I sat down on a seat by the window which looked out on that dismal yard, clutching a small leather case which contained three small sweet buns, a book, and a notebook in which I was in the habit of jotting down anything that occurred to me in connection with what I was writing.</s> <s>Currently I was finishing an essay on Kafka.</s></p>
<p><s>There were two other men sitting in the locker room already.</s> <s>One, tall and greying, reminded me of the specialist who many years before had removed my tonsils; the other, a short, stocky man of uncertain age in very dishevelled and dirty trousers scarcely reaching halfway down his calves and with enormous sewn-on pockets rather like misshapen pistol holsters, wore on his head a sea-captain's cap with a peak and a gleaming golden anchor above it.</s> <s>From beneath the peak a pair of eyes the colour of shallow coastal waters were watching me curiously.</s> <s>Those eyes, or rather their glance, seemed somehow familiar.</s> <s>He obviously realised that I was new here and advised me to put my identity card on the table.</s> <s>I did as he said, and as he placed his next to mine I noticed that he did not have a right hand; a black hook protruded from his sleeve.</s></p>
<p><s>By now my new workmates were beginning to arrive - the sweepers.</s> <s>A squat young idiot with a nervous facial tic sat down next to me, took out a pair of dirty shaft-boots from a locker, and turned them upside down.</s> <s>From one of them there ran out a quantity of liquid which might just have, but most probably did not, come from a tap.</s> <s>He immediately began to scream at us all in a language of which I was unable to make out a single word.</s></p>
<p><s>I am not sure myself what made me decide to try this unattractive occupation.</s> <s>Most probably I thought that I would gain from it an unexpected view of the world.</s> <s>Every so often you feel that unless you look at the world and at people from a new angle your mind will get blunted.</s></p>
<p><s>As I was waiting for what would happen next there suddenly came to my mind the scene, fifteen years ago, when I was about to.</s> <s>return home from my stay in America and the dean there gave a dinner in my honour.</s> <s>The dean was a mathematician, and wealthy.</s> <s>He owned a stableful of horses and a house in the style of a hunting lodge.</s> <s>I had only met him once before and I didn't really want to go to the dinner: a crowd of strangers tends to depress me.</s> <s>But then, how could I have known anyone properly when I had been teaching at the university for a mere six months?</s> <s>In the event they all turned out to be pleasant to me and full of smiles as Americans are, and with varying degrees of urgency they asked me to explain what on earth possessed me to want to leave their free and wealthy country to return home, to a poor and unfree country, where they'd probably lock me up or send me to Siberia.</s> <s>I tried to be equally pleasant.</s> <s>I conjured up some kind of patriotism, some kind of mission, until I hit on a convincing explanation.</s> <s>I said that back home people knew me.</s> <s>Even if I had to sweep up garbage in the streets I would be for them what I was, what I wanted to be to the exclusion of anything else, a writer, whereas here, even if I could drive around in my little Ford, I would always be just one of those immigrants on whom a great country had taken pity.</s> <s>These were my boastful words.</s> <s>In reality I wanted to return home, to the place where there were people I was fond of, where I was able to speak fluently, to savour the language I loved.</s></p>
<p><s>Now I knew that if I was a street-sweeper I would, for the majority of.</s> <s>the people, be simply a person who swept the streets, a person hardly noticed.</s> <s>Fortunately I didn't care too much about what I was in the eyes of other people.</s></p>
<p><s>At that moment a woman appeared in the cloakroom.</s> <s>She had a good figure, with slim hips in tight-fitting jeans.</s> <s>Her face was suntanned and wrinkled like that of the old Indian women I had seen in the market of Santa Fe.</s> <s>One of them, the oldest and most Indian-looking, had, to my great delight, a notice above her stall, revealing that her Christian name was Venus.</s> <s>This Mrs Venus here did not even sit down; from her handbag she produced a packet of Start cigarettes, and as she lit up I noticed that her hands were shaking.</s> <s>The match went out before the cigarette was alight, and Venus swore at it.</s> <s>Her voice was so drink-sodden, deep and hoarse, and her intonation so perfectly matched her appearance, that the leading ladies of the foremost theatres, who often have to play common women, could have taken lessons from her.</s></p>
<p><s>Next came a youngster with a shy, pale and girlish face and a capacious postman's bag over his shoulder, and then a few nondescript elderly men.</s> <s>In the background a short plump man with shrewd features began to change into his working clothes.</s> <s>Like the little idiot next to me he had his own locker.</s> <s>From it he pulled out some khaki overalls.</s></p>
<p><s>On the dot of six the woman from the office entered and read out the names of those assigned to cleaning our district of the city that day.</s> <s>First she read out those who were to erect the traffic signs, then the team of three whose job it was to empty the public litter bins.</s> <s>Finally she gave the fat man in the overalls a sheet of paper and announced that the following were detailed for the work party: Zoulova, Pinz, Rada, Stych, and finally she read out my name.</s> <s>At the same time she handed me a sweeper's orange vest.</s> <s>I accepted it, quickly walked round the table and chose the locker nearest the corner.</s> <s>I opened the door, on which Bui dinh Thi was written in chalk, took my identity papers, buns, book and notebook from my case, stuffed everything into my pockets and closed the locker again.</s></p>
<p><s>We all walked out into the depressing yard, where some garbage trucks had arrived noisily and where two young men were flinging shovels, brooms, scrapers, wheelbarrows, traffic signs and battered dustbins onto a pick-up.</s> <s>It was only a quarter past six in the morning, and already I could feel the stifling expanse of the day stretching out before me.</s></p>
<p><s>The man in the overalls, who'd clearly been assigned to us as our foreman, strode over to the gate and four figures stepped out from the bunch of sweepers, including the only woman, the youngster with the girlish face, and the man who reminded me of the ear-nose-and-throat specialist.</s> <s>Also the fellow with the captain's cap.</s> <s>These people seemed as alien to me as the work which I was about to perform with them; nevertheless I walked along, just as they did, at a pace which would have been more appropriate to a funeral cortege.</s> <s>With measured tread we strode through the streets of Nusle in our orange uniforms; all around us people were hurrying to work, but we were in no hurry, we were at work already.</s></p>
<p><s>This was not a state of mind in which I found myself often: most of my life I had been in a hurry, obsessed by the thought of what I had to accomplish if I wanted to be a good writer.</s> <s>I had wanted to become a writer ever since childhood, and authorship for a long time seemed to me the most exalted profession.</s> <s>I believed that a writer should be as wise as a prophet, as pure and rare as a saint, as adroit and fearless as an acrobat on a flying trapeze.</s> <s>Even though I now know that there are no chosen professions, and that what appears to be wisdom, purity, exceptional character, fearlessness and adroitness in one person may seem eccentricity, madness, dullness and uselessness in another, that ancient idea has struck, against my will, in my conscious and subconscious mind, and that is probably why I am afraid to describe myself by the term 'writer'.</s> <s>When I am asked what I do I try to avoid an answer.</s> <s>Besides, who dare say of himself that he is a writer?</s> <s>At best he can say: I've written some books.</s> <s>Now and again I even think that I am unable to define clearly what the subject of my work is, or what is already and what is not yet literature.</s></p>
<p><s>Now I was able to enjoy a leisurely walk and the reassuring knowledge that I knew exactly what was expected of me.</s> <s>Slowly we passed the National Committee and the Supreme Court building and arrived at what used to be the Sokol gym hall, where our equipment was already waiting for us: brooms, shovels, scrapers and a handcart whose body was half a dustbin.</s> <s>To show my goodwill I took the biggest shovel.</s></p>
<p><s>As a child I had lived on the outskirts of Prague, in a villa which stood next door to a tavern patronised by hauliers.</s> <s>Every day, just before noon, the municipal sweeper would arrive.</s> <s>He'd draw up his cart in the open space where the hauliers had pulled up with their horses, take out his shovel and almost ceremonially sweep up the horse droppings, or any other rubbish, and drop it all into his cart.</s> <s>He would then push his cart up against the wall and make for the bar.</s> <s>I liked him: he wore a peaked cap, though not a sailor's cap, and an upturned moustache in memory of our last emperor.</s> <s>I also liked his occupation, which I thought must surely be one of the most important jobs a man could have, and I believed that street-sweepers therefore enjoyed everyone's respect.</s> <s>In reality this was not so.</s> <s>Those who cleansed the world of garbage or of rats were never shown any respect.</s> <s>A few days ago, when I was reading something about the centre of Prague, where Franz Kafka used to walk, I came across the mention of an Italian stucco worker named Spinelli who, exactly two hundred years ago, in St George's church, had slashed the face, mouth and shoulders of his lover Marianne, the daughter of the royal gardener of the castle of Prague.</s> <s>For that he was gaoled, and taken to the place of execution, but was then reprieved and instead sentenced to clean the streets of Prague for three years.</s> <s>Respect as a rule was shown only to those who cleansed the world of human refuse, to bailiffs, judges and inquisitors.</s></p>
<p><s>When I wrote a short story twenty years ago about the slaughtering of horses - I had actually seen this at a slaughterhouse in Poland — I invented an apocalyptic scene about the incineration of their remains.</s> <s>I tried to get into the Prague incinerator, which as a boy I used to see burning in the distance, reducing everything to one gigantic pile of clinker, but the manager refused to let me inside.</s> <s>He was probably afraid I might wish to uncover some shortcomings in the operation of his crematorium.</s></p>
<p><s>Many years later, when I was working as a cleaner at the Krc hospital, I had to cart all the refuse to the big furnace every morning: blood-soaked bandages, gauze full of pus and hair, dirty rags smelling of human excrement, and of course masses of paper, empty tins, broken glass and plastic.</s> <s>I'd shovel everything into the furnace and watch with relief as the rubbish writhed as if in agony, as it melted in the fierce flames, and listen to the cracking and exploding sounds of the glass and to the victorious roar of the fire.</s> <s>On one occasion, I never discovered why, whether the fire was too fierce or, on the contrary, not hot enough, or whether it was the wind, the rubbish did not burn but the draught in the furnace sucked it up and spewed it out from the high chimney-stack, up towards the sky, and I watched with horror and amazement as all my refuse — rags, paper and tatters of bloody bandages — slowly descended to the ground, as it was caught in the branches of the trees, or sailed towards the open windows of the wards.</s> <s>And at that moment the idiots and imbeciles from the Social Welfare Institute, who were responsible for the upkeep of the hospital grounds, came rushing out howling with delight and pointing to a tall silver birch which was draped like a Christmas tree.</s></p>
<p><s>It occurred to me that what had just happened was no more than an instructive demonstration of an everyday occurrence.</s> <s>No matter ever vanishes.</s> <s>It can, at most, change its form.</s> <s>Rubbish is immortal, it pervades the air, swells up in water, dissolves, rots, disintegrates, changes into gas, into smoke, into soot, it travels across the world and gradually engulfs it.</s></p>
<p><s>We started in Lomnickeho Street.</s> <s>Our Venus, whose name was evidently Zoulova, was wielding a broom; she was helped, with a second broom, by the man with the captain's cap who most of the time chewed silently, now and again spitting out some frothy phlegm.</s> <s>They were sweeping the stuff onto my shovel and I would fling all the filthy mess into the dustbin on our handcart.</s> <s>When the dustbin was full we turned it upside down and tipped everything onto the pavement, all the rubbish in one heap; this would later be picked up and removed by the garbage truck.</s> <s>In this way we marked out our progress with those heaps and slowly advanced to Vysehrad.</s> <s>I looked at the tinted foliage of the trees, they were waving to me from the distance even though no one was waiting for me under them, even though she was no longer waiting for me.</s> <s>I think of her only as 'she*.</s> <s>In my mind I do not give her a name.</s> <s>Names get fingered and worn just like tender words.</s> <s>Sometimes in my mind I called her a soothsayer, because she used to foretell people's futures and she seemed knowing to me.</s> <s>Also she was surrounded by mystery, and made more beautiful by it.</s> <s>When she was christened she was named Daria.</s></p>
<p><s>I could not remember if we'd ever been here with each other.</s> <s>Our meetings over the years had blended together, and the years had piled up as in the folksong about the farm labourer.</s> <s>I'd met her as a result of visiting a friend who lived in a caravan; he was training to be a geologist's assistant.</s> <s>My attention was caught by a little sculpture whose fantastic character set it aside from the spartan interior of the caravan.</s> <s>My friend, who until a little while before had been writing art reviews, told me about the woman artist whose world was bounded by dreams, phantoms, passion and tenderness.</s> <s>He assured me that a visit to her studio was a profound experience, and I made a note of her address.</s> <s>One day when I was out looking for a birthday present for my wife I remembered that address.</s></p>
<p><s>Her workshop was in a modest-sized vaulted basement in Prague's Little City district.</s> <s>A third of the room was taken up by wooden shelves holding her work.</s></p>
<p><s>She received me courteously and we chatted for a while; she even told me about her little girl and asked me what I and my wife did.</s> <s>But I thought her interest was due to the fact that I had come to her as a customer.</s></p>
<p><s>She moved adroitly among her shelves.</s> <s>As she walked there was a movement of eyes and lips on her long skirt, a pattern of brown eyes and bright red lips.</s> <s>Her own eyes were blue and her lips rather pale.</s> <s>What would happen if I embraced her among her shelves?</s> <s>But I knew that I wouldn't.</s></p>
<p><s>I bought a bird with a slender neck on which sat a sharp-edged little head with small, impish, human eyes.</s> <s>She wrapped my purchase in tissue paper and saw me to the door.</s> <s>After that we didn't see one another for many months.</s> <s>But on the eve of my forty-seventh birthday she unexpectedly appeared at my front door: she wished to borrow her little sculpture for an exhibition that was to be held in Budapest.</s> <s>I asked her in and introduced her to my wife, who was delighted to make her acquaintance.</s> <s>The three of us sat in my study.</s> <s>Lida, who likes making people happy, said how much she liked her little figurine.</s></p>

<p><s>In February 1948, Communist leader Klement Gottwald stepped out on the balcony of a Baroque palace in Prague to address the hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens packed into Old Town Square.</s> <s>It was a crucial moment in Czech history—a fateful moment of the kind that occurs once or twice in a millennium.</s></p>
<p><s>Gottwald was flanked by his comrades, with Clementis standing next to him.</s> <s>There were snow flurries, it was cold, and Gottwald was bareheaded.</s> <s>The solicitous Clementis took off his own fur cap and set it on Gottwald's head.</s></p>
<p><s>The Party propaganda section put out hundreds of thousands of copies of a photograph of that balcony with Gottwald, a fur cap on his head and comrades at his side, speaking to the nation.</s> <s>On that balcony the history of Communist Czechoslovakia was born.</s> <s>Every child knew the photograph from posters, schoolbooks, and museums.</s></p>
<p><s>Four years later Clementis was charged with treason and hanged.</s> <s>The propaganda section immediately airbrushed him out of history and, obviously, out of all the photographs as well.</s> <s>Ever since, Gottwald has stood on that balcony alone.</s> <s>Where Clementis once stood, there is only bare palace wall.</s> <s>All that remains of Clementis is the cap on Gottwald's head.</s></p>

<p><s>It is 1971, and Mirek says that the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.</s></p>
<p><s>That is his attempt to justify what his friends call carelessness: keeping a careful diary, preserving all correspondence, taking notes at meetings where there is discussion of the current situation and debate of where to go from here.</s> <s>Nothing we do is in violation of the constitution, he tells them.</s> <s>Trying to hide, feeling guilty— that's the beginning of the end.</s></p>
<p><s>A week ago, while working with a crew on the roof of a new building, he looked down and had a sudden dizzy spell.</s> <s>He lost his balance and grabbed at a poorly fastened beam, but it came loose and he had to be pulled out from under it.</s> <s>At first the injury looked serious, but later, when he learned it was just a run-of-the-mill broken arm, he said to himself with satisfaction that now he'd get a week or two off and have time for some things he'd been meaning to take care of.</s></p>
<p><s>He had finally come around to the position of his more cautious friends.</s> <s>True, the constitution guaranteed freedom of speech; but the law punished any act that could be construed as undermining the state.</s> <s>Who could tell when the state would start screaming that this or that word was undermining it?</s> <s>He decided he'd better put the incriminating papers in a safe place after all.</s></p>
<p><s>First, though, he wanted to settle the Zdena problem.</s> <s>He called her long distance, but couldn't reach her.</s> <s>He wasted four whole days calling.</s> <s>Then yesterday he'd finally gotten through.</s> <s>She'd promised to wait for him this afternoon.</s></p>
<p><s>His seventeen-year-old son protested that he couldn't possibly drive with his arm in a cast.</s> <s>It really was pretty hard going.</s> <s>His injured arm swung helpless and useless in its sling on his chest.</s> <s>Whenever he changed gears, he had to let go of the steering wheel for a second.</s></p>
<C 3>
<p><s>Twenty-five years had gone by since his affair with Zdena, and all he had left of it was a few memories.</s></p>
<p><s>Once she showed up dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and blowing her nose.</s> <s>He asked her what the matter was.</s> <s>A Russian statesman had died the day before, she told him.</s> <s>Some Zhdanov, Arbuzov, or Masturbov.</s> <s>Judging by the number of teardrops, she was more disturbed by Masturbov's death than by the death of her own father.</s></p>
<p><s>Could that actually have happened?</s> <s>Or was her lament for Masturbov merely a figment of his present hatred?</s> <s>No, it had happened, though of course the immediate circumstances making the event credible and real escaped him now, and the memory had become implausible, a caricature.</s></p>
<p><s>All his memories of her were like that.</s> <s>They had taken a tram back from the apartment where they made love for the first time.</s> <s>(Mirek was particularly gratified to note that he had completely forgotten their copulations, couldn't conjure up a single second of them.) Bumping up and down in a corner seat, she looked gloomy, introspective, amazingly old.</s> <s>When he asked her why she was so withdrawn, she told him she hadn't been satisfied with their love-making.</s> <s>She said he'd made love to her like an intellectual.</s></p>
<p><s>In the political jargon of the day "intellectual" was an expletive.</s> <s>It designated a person who failed to understand life and was cut off from the people.</s> <s>All Communists hanged at the time by other Communists had that curse bestowed upon them.</s> <s>Unlike people with their feet planted firmly on the ground, they supposedly floated in air.</s> <s>In a sense, then, it was only fair they have the ground pulled out from under them once and for all and be left there hanging slightly above it.</s></p>
<p><s>But what did Zdena mean when she accused him of making love like an intellectual?</s></p>
<p><s>For one reason or another she hadn't been satisfied with him, and just as she was capable of imbuing an abstract relationship (her relationship to a stranger like Masturbov) with the most concrete of feelings (in the form of tears), she could give the most concrete of acts an abstract meaning and her dissatisfaction a political name.</s></p>

<p><s>Looking into the rearview mirror, he realized that a car had been tailing him all along.</s> <s>He had never had any doubt he was being followed, but so far they had acted with masterly discretion.</s> <s>Today a radical change had taken place: they wanted him to know about them.</s></p>
<p><s>In the middle of some fields about fifteen miles outside Prague there was a tall fence with a car-repair shop behind it.</s> <s>He had a good friend there and needed him to replace a faulty starter.</s> <s>He pulled up to the entrance.</s> <s>It was blocked by a red-and-white-striped gate.</s> <s>A heavy woman was standing beside it.</s> <s>Mirek waited for her to raise the gate, but she just stared at him, motionless.</s> <s>He honked his horn, but got no response.</s> <s>He looked out the window.</s> <s>"Not behind bars yet?"</s> <s>asked the woman.</s></p>
<p><s>"No, not yet," answered Mirek.</s> <s>"How about raising the gate?"</s></p>
<p><s>She looked at him impassively for a few more long seconds, then yawned, went over to the gatekeeper's cabin, dropped into a desk chair, and turned her back on him.</s></p>
<p><s>So he got up out of the car, walked around the gate, and went into the service area to look for his friend the mechanic.</s> <s>The mechanic came back with him.</s> <s>He raised the gate himself (the woman was still sitting impassively in the cabin), and Mirek drove his car in.</s></p>
<p><s>"That's what you get for showing off on television," said the mechanic.</s> <s>"Every broad in the country knows what you look like."</s></p>
<p><s>"Who is she?"</s> <s>Mirek asked.</s></p>
<p><s>He learned that the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Russian troops, which had made themselves felt everywhere, had changed her life as well.</s> <s>Seeing that people in higher places (and everyone was higher than she was) were being deprived of power, status, employment, and daily bread on the basis of the slightest allegation, she got all excited and started denouncing people herself.</s></p>
<p><s>"Then how come she's still working the gate?</s> <s>Haven't they even promoted her?"</s></p>
<p><s>The mechanic smiled.</s> <s>"They can't.</s> <s>She doesn't know how to count to five.</s> <s>All they can do is let her go on with her denunciations.</s> <s>That's her only reward."</s> <s>He raised the hood and peered inside at the engine.</s></p>
<p><s>Mirek was suddenly aware of someone a few steps away.</s> <s>He turned and saw a man in a gray jacket, white shirt and tie, and brown slacks.</s> <s>His strong neck and bloated face were topped by a shock of artificially waved gray hair.</s> <s>He stood there watching the mechanic leaning under the raised hood.</s></p>
<p><s>After a while the mechanic noticed him too.</s> <s>"Looking for somebody?"</s> <s>he asked, straightening up.</s></p>
<p><s>"No," answered the man with the strong neck and wavy hair.</s> <s>"I'm not looking for anybody."</s></p>
<p><s>The mechanic leaned down over the engine again and said, "Right in the middle of Prague, Wenceslaus Square, there's this guy throwing up.</s> <s>And this other guy comes along, takes a look at him, shakes his head, and says, 'I know just what you mean.'"</s></p>

<C CONCERT>
<p><s>For every fisherman, it is best to be initiated into the lore of fishing as a child by a father, an uncle, or a ferryman.</s> <s>In our case, it was the ferryman Karel Prosek from Luh-under-Branov, whom we grew to love as an uncle.</s></p>
<p><s>He not only taught me and my brothers Hugoand Jirka how to catch fish, but he taught my cunning Papa, too.</s> <s>Uncle Prosek knew so much about fish that he was probably born in the Berounka River like a water sprite and tumbled into Luh on the waters of a flood.</s> <s>He had a sonorous voice, a fine figure, and a beautiful moustache like a dragon.</s> <s>He could do anything in the world!</s> <s>He could plow and sow, milk cows, cook potato pancakes, find wild boletus mushrooms even out of season, ferry people in his boat during high waters, weave baskets, hunt deer, rescue travelers and half-frozen animals, silence the stupid, and he knew how to laugh.</s> <s>Many times, during high waters, he would ferry the mid-wife Flybertova and her indispensable suitcase.</s> <s>And he knew how to catch fish.</s> <s>Many ways!</s> <s>He'd impale them from his boat on moonlit nights with a fork called a "grondle," he would sink down weirs in their path, or he would cast out a line in broad daylight and catch them on a rod like a gentleman.</s></p>
<p><s>This was during the time of the old Austrian monarchy, when Count Max Egon Furstenberg lived in Krivoklat castle eating hot goulash and drinking Rakovnik beer.</s> <s>Because Prosek was the best fisherman in the region, the Count allowed him to fish in any manner he chose and in any part of the river.</s> <s>But if he caught eels, with their meat like lotus blossoms, he must bring them to the castle!</s> <s>He carried the eels in a sack, which his wife Karolina sewed from canvas.</s> <s>He carried them, still living, along the Berounka to the castle.</s> <s>The gates would swing open majestically, as if for a conquering knight.</s> <s>Inside, he poured them into a pitched cask filled with water, and sometimes received a gold coin.</s> <s>The coin had the emperor on it and resembled the sun.</s></p>
<p><s>But after the Count climbed into his carriage and disappeared behind four foreign rivers, Prosek was forbidden variety in his manner of fishing.</s> <s>The rod, he was told, would be sufficient for all.</s> <s>Prosek had a long, yellow bamboo rod, a whip without a spool.</s> <s>He would walk against the rushing water so that the fish could not see him and crack the whip as he styled his dragoon's moustache.</s> <s>That is how his method got the name "crack-casting."</s></p>
<p><s>One day we drove up in our car, my Papa Leo, my Mama Herma, my brothers Hugo and Jirka, and myself, our whole family.</s> <s>From under the alder trees all of us were watching Prosek on the far side of the river.</s> <s>He moved across the slippery stones like an otter.</s> <s>His floater flew to the exact spot he aimed at.</s> <s>And the fish?</s> <s>They seemed to jump out of the water — silver chubs with red rudder fins, elegant whiskered barbels, big-bellied roaches from the tide pools, and daces from the swift currents.</s> <s>All of them slipped into his net, their freedom over, their master come, the King of Poachers.</s> <s>My Papa, ever enthusiastic, cried out, "Herma!</s> <s>What a concert!</s> <s>Just like Kubelik."</s> <s>Suddenly, I imagined rows of theatre seats along the shore in which gentlemen in English checked plus fours and ladies in pink crinolines sat sighing and applauding as each fish was caught.</s></p>
<p><s>Messieurs, mesdames, this is true art.</s> <s>In his overflowing net Prosek caught up the last fish, then lit a cigarette and bowed.</s> <s>The vision faded and Prosek was wading the shallow river towards us.</s> <s>Papa had immediately taken a liking to Prosek, because he too was a smart fellow.</s> <s>He could silence the stupid as well as Prosek could, and what he could not do Prosek would teach him.</s> <s>Ruffian Prosek suited my father well because his whole life he maintained that fine people are not worth shit.</s> <s>Papa and Prosek agreed that we would come to his ferry house for our summer vacations and his house alone.</s></p>
<C MY FIRST FISH>
<p><s>Prosek returned from the Anamo pub in high spirits, singing old army songs.</s> <s>He knew a lot of them, having fought during the war in Serbia and carrying still a fragment of shrapnel in his hip.</s> <s>This souvenir often pained him, but he claimed that it stopped hurting once he had several hard shots inside him.</s> <s>In this condition he arrived at the boat, kissed the Alsatian, Holan, on the snout and sat down under the sweet-smelling acacia.</s></p>
<p><s>I was at the ferry at that time because my brothers did not take me with them again.</s> <s>They preferred the company of Dasa, the daughter of Beda Peroutka, who ignored me.</s> <s>Prosek looked at me with his green eyes.</s> <s>"Come here, Jackass!"</s></p>
<p><s>I dragged myself slowly toward him.</s> <s>He did not love me much.</s> <s>His favorite was Jirka, a scoundrel after his own heart.</s> <s>I was the youngest, only a pet.</s> <s>Prosek stared at me and pulled out a pickle from his dirty pocket.</s> <s>"Here!"</s></p>
<p><s>I took my finger out of my mouth and put the pickle in.</s> <s>Prosek watched me.</s> <s>Then he pulled out his flask.</s> <s>"Drink some!" he commanded.</s></p>
<p><s>The bottle was empty, but I made a blissful face.</s> <s>The non-existing alcohol brought us together.</s> <s>When he got up to go to the barn, he motioned for me to follow him.</s> <s>Inside, he drew out a long hazel twig.</s> <s>"I'll make you a rod," he said.</s> <s>"I've been saving this twig for you for a long time."</s></p>
<p><s>Unsheathing his sharp pocketknife, he cut here and cut there.</s> <s>Fascinated, I followed his calloused hands, noting the one finger he was missing, which he had cut off while slicing twigs for baskets.</s> <s>I looked up at his face, the contortion of pain on it, and realized that the shrapnel in his hip must be flaring up again without booze to keep it cool.</s> <s>Despite the pain, Prosek finished my rod.</s> <s>At that moment, I had no idea that it would be the most precious rod that I would ever own, but I know it now.</s> <s>It was my childhood rod, unparalleled even by the advanced American and Japanese models I would covet in later years.</s> <s>Prosek strung a line to it, then added a goose quill and a hook.</s></p>
<p><s>"Near the island," he said, "you'll find perch.</s> <s>Go, jackass, and ruffle their feathers.</s> <s>I'll wait for you here."</s></p>
<p><s>Before running out of the barn, I turned back to see Prosek curling up to sleep with Holan's head in his lap.</s> <s>Following the path to the island, I reached my destination before noon.</s> <s>The sun was already quite warm.</s> <s>I baited the hook with a plump earthworm and cast the line, but nothing happened.</s> <s>The fish would not bite.</s> <s>Only bluish dragonflies sat on marsh marigolds while somewhere in the backwater chubs were snack-ing contentedly.</s> <s>The white quill lay upon the water like a sailboat on a dead sea.</s> <s>In my mind, I hoisted the sails and ordered the captain to get under way, and we were pulled across the drowsy surface by a colored fish.</s> <s>But the quill, in fact, was still.</s> <s>My eyelids grew heavy, but I managed to blink from time to time with one eye to see if my white ship had set sail.</s></p>
<p><s>Suddenly, the quill shook and a circle appeared around it.</s> <s>And again and again, as if signaling or flirting with my ship, as if the engine crank were being turned.</s> <s>So it was not a sailboat, but a white motorboat.</s> <s>Then it hopped, stood on its head, and put up its feet like a half-submerged duck.</s> <s>By then I was wide awake and holding the rod firmly, expecting at any moment the sight of a wild-maned perch.</s> <s>But the quill made a JUMP!</s> <s>and disappeared.</s> <s>I could see it racing under the surface towards the marsh marigolds.</s> <s>The rod bent into an arch, and for the first time in my life I felt the delicious pull of a fish.</s> <s>After a tremendous battle, a bristled mouth appeared.</s> <s>It was a perch all right, as big as a checked red cap, but it was also olive-green with dark stripes across it.</s> <s>The fish carried its red fins like flags of war, and with its hump it resembled a bull.</s> <s>Instead of eyes, I gazed into live gold coins, and spears seemed to protrude from its back.</s> <s>This was no fish!</s> <s>This was a dragon, or an armored knight with a red plume jutting from his helmet.</s></p>
<p><s>I hauled the fish onto the grass and lay on it so that it could not escape.</s> <s>We fought like two boys, then I carried it ceremoniously to the ferry.</s> <s>I had pricked myself on its spears, and there was blood on my fingers.</s> <s>I thought that from this day forward Uncle Prosek would care for me as much as he cared for Jirka.</s> <s>He was sitting on a bench drinking milk—goat vermouth— to chase away the alcohol.</s> <s>"You're a crackerjack!" he said.</s></p>
<p><s>Then he skinned the perch and nailed its head and skin to the barn door, announcing to everyone who could see that another fisherman had been born in Luh-under-Branov.</s></p>
<p><s>I sat on a milking stool for days beneath my trophy.</s> <s>When somebody passed by on their way to the ferry, I would cough and blow my nose if they did not immediately notice the perch.</s> <s>I basked in the praise.</s> <s>Even Dasa, daughter of Beda Peroutka, kissed me on the cheek.</s> <s>"You're the tops!"</s> <s>she said.</s></p>
<p><s>But one night my prize disappeared.</s> <s>Possibly the cat, Andelka, ate it.</s> <s>But it is more likely that my beloved Uncle Prosek removed it from the barn door.</s> <s>He had grown tired of my strutting about and was more than a little annoyed with me.</s></p>
<C BATTLE FOR PIKE>
<p><s>My brothers decided to accept me at last.</s> <s>We would catch small fish for bait, officially called gudgeons, but our name for them was chop, the same as a chop our mother would fry.</s> <s>The chop is a good looking fish, almost marbled and with two blue fins.</s> <s>God must have had a good time making them, but the chop is a trusting and stupid fish.</s></p>
<p><s>To catch chops we would stir up sand and mud with our feet, which the chops explored for food.</s> <s>They found instead our lines and hooked earthworms.</s> <s>They pecked like hens, pulling the floats, then we would yank on the lines and the chops would come into the daylight.</s> <s>Now and then they swam between our feet and pecked at our toes.</s> <s>Peck.</s> <s>Peck.</s> <s>Peck.</s> <s>We splashed our feet in cool water and fished at the same time.</s> <s>We put them into cans and then Papa and Uncle Prosek would use them to catch pike and other water cannibals.</s></p>
<p><s>But then the chops became scarce in the river and Uncle Prosek discovered that pike also found the meat of the prickly perch delicious.</s> <s>Imagine!</s> <s>Perch on the pike's menu, and nobody had known about it before!</s></p>
<p><s>At that time Beda Peroutka, a typographer from Zizkov and a fan of Victoria Zizkov, visited the Krivoklat region in his old wreck of a car with his wife, Vlasta.</s> <s>My Papa quickly made friends with him, and each Christmas they'd exchange potato salad in painted chamber-pots.</s> <s>They were all so young.</s> <s>When we drove from Krivoklat back to Prague, pike hung outside open cabriolets; behind the cars trussed-up pots and buckets jiggled.</s> <s>Speed was not important.</s> <s>During the trip the crews shouted slogans and obscenities at each other, but the women did not blush anymore because they were used to it.</s></p>
<p><s>At Krivoklat, Papa was supposed to call, "Here lives Holub the confectioner!"</s> <s>Following in his car, Peroutka would happily respond, "So bend and kiss the sweet spot, Bub!"</s></p>
<p><s>If my Papa forgot this ritual, Peroutka would sulk all that day and night.</s></p>
<p><s>Once in Luh, Beda decided to teach Prosek and Papa a thing or two about fishing and took off with Frantisek Pavlicek, the local champion, to catch pike at Devil's Rock.</s> <s>This fishing hole got its name, one story goes, because a gamekeeper once tripped over a rock and spilled his flask full of the devil over it; another more sober version has the Devil building a bridge one night over the Berounka River, which would enable him to kidnap a daughter from the fishery.</s> <s>But as the rooster began to crow, the bridge was still not finished.</s> <s>The Devil was left emptyhanded and had to stay on the rock.</s> <s>The pike, meanwhile, had always lived in the deep hole below the rock.</s></p>
<p><s>When Papa found out about them, he and Prosek armed themselves with beautiful perch for bait and steered their boat upstream beyond the island to the pike pools at Brtva.</s></p>
<p><s>They caught enormous pike.</s> <s>One even had such an appetite that it jumped clear out of the water to get its perch.</s></p>
<p><s>They returned shortly before Beda, who when he arrived stood on the far bank chuckling and holding over his head a pike of at least two kilos!</s> <s>"Beat this!"</s> <s>he bellowed.</s> <s>"Come across, you fool!"</s> <s>Papa shouted.</s></p>
<p><s>Once Beda had crossed over, Papa took hold of his arm and led him to the creel.</s> <s>They peered into the box at the dark green silhouetted backs of three pike.</s> <s>Beda splashed himself with water so that he would not faint and tumble into the river.</s></p>
<p><s>"You bastards!"</s> <s>he gasped.</s> <s>  "You cheated!"</s> <s>In the evening under the acacia tree, Papa confided the secret of the perch-as-bait and told him where to get pike the next morning.</s> <s>That acacia had such power that anyone sitting under it had to tell the truth.</s> <s>Even fishermen.</s></p>
<T Vancura>
<C An Admonition>
<p><s>"I want to warn you" said Hugo, "that everything that I might be capable of respecting in people in vulgar trades is a little bit of calm.</s> <s>But you keep shouting!</s> <s>Be quiet!</s> <s>I'll take this weapon and put myself in a position to answer you."</s></p>
<p><s>With that, the major seized a pole, which was used for straightening out the pupils' limbs during boating lessons , and striking a pose, knees bent, with a neat lunge, he knocked over the empty bottle.</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh my giddy aunt!</s> <s>" exclaimed Antonín, " what are you doing.</s> <s>Look, the abbé will die of fright."</s></p>
<p><s>However, meanwhile, the canon had been leafing through his book and having found the place he was looking for, said:</s></p>
<p><s>"Very well, very well, with fist or axe handle do away with this den of pornography.</s> <s>It deserves its fate.</s> <s>Go for it, with all your might, I know the way to bring you down a peg or two."</s></p>
<p><s>Then he went over to the major, who was still conducting a ferocious campaign, and raising his voice read from Book VII of Horace's odes, while the great Antonín, knowing no other means of expressing the strength which was gushing and fighting its way out of his healthy body, grabbed a block of wood and raised it high a hundred and one times.</s></p>
<C Courtship>
<p><s>Mrs Kateøina Dùra, hanging on the canon's every word, as he spouted fine verses, producing them as if from up his sleeve, crossed her hands over her breast and said:</s></p>
<p><s>"I am standing here and I hear what you say, sir.</s> <s>Latin, I am told, is the language of the Romans, and it is said that this language has died and that it is dead.</s> <s>What nonsense, abbé, you spoke so fluently and at such length for us to discount that.</s></p>
<p><s>However, now take a rest and say something to me in our own language, for I have to confess that I understand only half of what is said in Latin It goes on so much!</s> <s>I think it is a little overdone, all that well set out way of saying something, it puts me in mind of a hailstorm, I don't doubt though that you were talking about high-minded sentiments.</s></p>
<p><s>Oh, of course!</s> <s>There have been occasions when we came out with comical little sayings, sang songs or played musical instruments just to make the time pass quicker.</s> <s>Alas, sir, you would have gone off your head listening to some organist as he stuck me in the ribs singing one song after another .</s> <s>I am sure that his inventiveness to a large extent would equal your professional skill, no matter what foreign lands you have seen or schools you have been to throughout your long life.</s></p>
<p><s>With this the lady swept the rods , lines and other bits of tackle that are essential to the angler off the bench and striding over the washboard which had fallen on the ground, dragged the bench over to the southern end of the pool.</s></p>
<p><s>"Well now, sir," Kateøina Dùra went on, when she had sat down.</s> <s>"Come over here, come sit by me, this seat isn't as uncomfortable as it might seem and we can get by here without Latin.</s></p>
<p><s>"Those two," she added, gesturing to the master and the major, won't understand a single word.</s> <s>I bet that they are talking about guns and some crazy competition.</s> <s>Oh, just look at my husband stretching out his left arm and no doubt trying to convince the major that there is immense strength involved in the operation.</s> <s>Oh, what am I to do if this ill-bred man is forever shouting just to exercise his lungs and increase his chest size?</s> <s>What am I to do if I see him day in and day out hopping about and pole vaulting as high as the ceiling?"</s></p>
<p><s>"The master," riposted the canon, " is taking care of and looking after his body perhaps rather too much, however, I have never egged him on nor encouraged him to do it without reservation.</s> <s>The master, you and I are all at the age when one doesn't shout at the top of one's voice and we can obviate the neighbour's fence without trying to jump over it.</s> <s>I don't like show offs.</s></p>
<C The Path of Virtue>
<p><s>"That is so, that is so, abbé," agreed the lady, rising from her seat, " but if we consider your age, you ought to be more indulgent.</s> <s>The innocent game, which, as you can see, my husband is playing, may be silly, but it isn't sinful and doesn't merit such harsh condemnation.</s> <s>I do not know what ill feelings have got into you or the reason for your creating alarm.</s> <s>Good heavens!</s> <s>Go back to your Latin, which turns out to be such irritating nonsense."</s></p>
<p><s>With that, Kateøina turned to her husband and told him that the canon was a perverse man, of whom one should be careful.</s></p>
<p><s>"Ah," said Antonín Dùra, that leaves me unmoved, that does not concern me."</s></p>
<p><s>And leaving his wife without any fuller answer than this, he continued urging the major to show him the pass of which he had been speaking.</s></p>
<p><s>"Here it is, here it is," exclaimed Hugo, jabbing the pole into a crack between the planks, which at a distance resembled a ribcage.</s></p>
<C A New Courtship>
<p><s>"You are an ominous man, major," said Mrs Dùra."You're always sweaty, legs always apart, arms outstretched, with two or three flashing glances, you almost look like an army sergeant, whom I used to know rather intimately in my younger days..</s> <s>Oh, he was a real man about town, more needs to be said about him.</s> <s>He was as argumantative as you and I often had to calm his quick temper.</s> <s>I used o offer him everything that I considered suitable to tame his prickliness.</s> <s>None the less he used to twist his buttons in his impatient fingers and drink one bottle after another.</s> <s>Unlike you, who served in an artillery regiment and didn't wear red trousers, he was with the engineers ."</s> <s>"It was just as well for me," said the major, "that I didn't wear them, for those regiments are staffed with yokels.</s></p>
<p><s>"Really?</s> <s>said the lady," I have never heard an opinion like that before.</s> <s>Those people sold like hot cakes in our street.</s></p>
<p><s>You know, sir, that I am a city person and that I was unhappy to leave there to come to this damned place.</s> <s>I get goose pimples when I think of the clients we have these days.</s> <s>As far as weapons and clothing are concerned, the infantry does not equal the cavalry by a long chalk, they are a hundred, a thousand times better than that crew.</s> <s>In the crowd of invalids that come hurrying here every summer, a good-looking corporal from the twenty-eighth more than stands out and then I have had it.</s></p>
<p><s>In my day, the abbé was already old, however, you explain to me by what malign concatenation of circumstances I never met you."</s></p>
<p><s>"Now, now, now," said the major, his anger abating to a moderate degree, "perhaps some greenhorn new recruit showed up among my howitzers , who could have aroused the interest of the ladies working in the kitchens with his dashing moustache and whom I tormented.</s> <s>Don't reproach me for that.</s> <s>I had no intentions on account of their choice.</s> <s>Anyway, as far as I know, your husband, to whom you are duty-bound in all decency , if only because he took you away from the those dreadful suburbs, served neither with the engineers nor with the artillery, since he was a sapper.</s></p>
<p><s>"As if I didn't know!</s> <s>As if I didn't know where he served, " answered the lady.</s> <s>"If you want to cause an argument, say something else and Master Antonín will give you a good hiding.</s> <s>Perhaps you have a club which you suppose to be a rapier.</s> <s>My dear boy, my Antonín will not tolerate his wife being spoken to in a free and easy manner.</s></p>
<C The Affable Swimming Instructor>
<p><s>Meanwhile the Sunday was approaching nine o'clock and a few ladies had come out to the pool who were in all weathers mindful of the care which good physical regimen demanded.</s> <s>Antonín greeted them with as much ceremony as possible.</s></p>
<p><s>"Do come in," he said, "Do come in without delay..</s> <s>Don't let yourselves be intimidated by the cold yopu feel.</s> <s>The abbé and the major have designated today bathing beyond humidity ."</s></p>
<p><s>"Good day to you," said Hugo, touching his hat.</s></p>
<p><s>"Good day," they replied with longing smiles, for the major had the reputation of a rake.</s></p>
<p><s>"Do go over to the reserved places," said the instructor, " here are the bathing robe s you need, face flannel and soap.</s> <s>If you need anything, just call three times, so that I can come in promptly."</s></p>
<p><s>"My husband," said Mrs Dùra, " is barmy, none the less he knows his rights and knows how to exercise them.</s></p>
<p><s>If he curtailed his rights, if he cut them away , if he burnt them or drowned them and if, in short, he got rid of them, he would be a master, but this way he is only Antonín "</s></p>
<p><s>"Of course," riposted again the lady, "he is Antonín, for I am Kateøina."</s></p>
<p><s>"Hurrah, said the abbé, "I see that you have acquired something of the logic which disarms me."</s></p>
<C A Warning>
<p><s>In the mean time, the newly arrived ladies had undressed and, emitting moans, were entering the water, which was striking at their buttocks like a cane.</s></p>
<p><s>"In this society," said Antonín, sitting down tentatively on the canon's book, "it will be better for us to talk.</s> <s>I am sure that the abbé will forget his metamorphoses relating to women who for five years haven't progressed beyond the age of thirty.</s> <s>Your continuing to be in fine fettle, major, is to be seen as perfectly as can be ."</s></p>
<p><s>"I am leaving," said the major, "for it is a rule that one of these fine bathing beauties will drown before our very eyes.</s> <s>Be on the ball when occasion demands and on your guard when dealing with underage females."</s></p>
<p><s>The canon protested that there was no need to pay attention to anyone, but none the less Hugo packed his boxes away and gave no further thought to fishing.</s></p>
<p><s>"Major," said Antonín, "I have never behaved brusquely towards you, but I am afraid that now I am going to be forced to restrain you by force..</s> <s>It is necessary that these baths, this damned raft, be populated at least ostensibly .</s> <s>It suits me to have you sitting here with your face of an imposing fifty year old.</s> <s>I can keep an eye on your rod and your fishing in my precinct, but I won't put up with you being on the opposite bank.</s> <s>How would you like those women to get out of the water and my pool to remain empty until evening!</s> <s>How would you like to bring ruin on my business!"</s></p>
<p><s>"It seems to me," said the major with a deprecating gesture, "that you are identifying us with the agents provocateurs whom you meet in hostelries .</s> <s>It further seems to me that you are overly confident of our levels of toleration."</s></p>
<p><s>"Toleration, said the master, "is a quality of all military leaders."</s></p>
<C Arnoštek the Magician>
<p><s>While these conversations were proceeding, Arnoštek the magician, who had just arrived in Krokovy Vary, was making his way through the celebrated willow trees.</s> <s>Cognisant of the fact that he was exhausted from his long journey as well as dirty and having noticed the rather inviting bathing pool, after a little hesitation he had climbed down on to the road, walked over a narrow plank and unexpectedly found himself at the pool.</s></p>
<p><s>"I see that it is clearing up and by noon it will be very hot," said Antonín, "Take your things off, gentlemen.</s> <s>However, you who have just arrived, wait a little while until you have cooled down, since you are worn out hot tired .</s></p>
<p><s>"Well," replied Arnoštek, "well, sir, you have touched me on a raw nerve, Do you know that I haven't warmed myself for a whole week except by my own candle ?</s> <s>I am Arnoštek the magician and in view of the inclement weather here (for I come from southern climes), each evening I touch various areas of my body with a candle flame."</s></p>
<p><s>"Ah," said Mrs Dùra, "you're the person the whole town has been talking about since yesterday..</s> <s>It's you!</s> <s>You, sir, as I am given to understand, are a fire-eater and the one and the same person who has been to Paris and comes from the Netherlands."</s></p>
<p><s>"I have been all over those parts," answered the magician somewhat uncertainly, "But if people are talking about someone here, then it probably isn't me!</s> <s>I arrived by wagon at around nine o'clock.</s> <s>We have a pitch in the town square.</s> <s>From there, apart from a few occasions in the strzmistr's office, I have been coming out to these riverside bathing areas.</s> <s>If there is, however, some charlatan around here who is passing himself off as a magician, I'll be forced to leave without even giving a performance or even taking a swim."</s></p>
<p><s>"Don't be impatient," said the lady.</s> <s>"Who is saying anything like that?</s> <s>You are here and you will stay in your place.</s></p>
<p><s>These men," she added, "taking the big brush and little brush for the ladies, which they have requested for their complexion, these men are short-tempered.</s> <s>I have scarcely told a magician that he is a magician and they'll start carrying on as if he weren't one."</s></p>
<p><s>"What's so special about a magician," said the ladies, scrubbing away.</s> <s>He's always some hairy individual who chews broken glass in front of the public and pulls nine wigs out of his sleeve."</s></p>
<p><s>"I don't know," said Kateøina Dùra, " however, unlike the folk around here, Mr Armoštek has curly hair and doesn't seem to have a liking for weapons and book learning."</s></p>
<C The Magician's Appearance>
<p><s>Meanwhile Arnoštek unbuttoned his coat and undressed, hanging items of clothing one after another on hook and peg.</s> <s>At last he came out, displaying slender hips and a ribcage protruding from his back by about six inches.</s> <s>He was wearing a red Flanders leotard and did not need a swimming costume.</s></p>
<p><s>"This outfit is perhaps suitable for other occasions," said the major, "but why shouldn't we let him in?"</s></p>
<p><s>"It's too naughty," riposted the abbé,"and it is ij your interest, Antoníne, to put some leggings on your guest.</s> <s>Can't you see that all his limbs are sticking out of that garment and can't you see that it is pink?</s> <s>Pink is the colour of pigs."</s></p>
<p><s>Antonín was taking away the leftovers of some lunch and had pots and pans and plates piled up on a wide board, but when he heard the canon's words he turned round with his load to contradict him.</s></p>
<p><s>"Here we have it," he said, concluding his deliberations as to whether pink was the colour of pigs, grey a scholarly colour and black the colour of sewer rats.</s></p>
<C Inarticulate Professors>
<p><s>"Damnation!" said the major.</s> <s>"Master, you're not going to give yourself completely just like that .</s> <s>How is it that you are so articulate?"</s></p>
<p><s>"There are," he replied, "many reasons.</s> <s>I can tell you the most important of them: it is because I am not a bookworm.</s></p>
<p><s>Five or six years ago a professor of Charles University was living here, a circumspect man.</s> <s>A real squabbler on paper, a man who was keen on literature both old and new, and yet, do you know, he could not tell you properly the number of the cabin, where he had undressed.</s> <s>Ever since then, I have taken the view that education of that type is nothing but a bind, if we want to express ourselves.</s></p>
<C Not Very Prepossessing Geniuses>
<p><s>Armoštek the magician did not take part ijn these dicussion.</s> <s>He stood there leaning on the railing around the pool, he stood there, his legs crossed, he looked and could have been puffing away on a pipe..</s> <s>In short, he was standing there looking and looking there standing.</s></p>
<p><s>"I can see," said the major, "that having a crooked ribcage doesn't deprive magicians of their self-assurance."</s></p>
<p><s>"I am not sure how things are with magicians , but it is true that Byron had a limp.</s> <s>It is true that Homer was blind.</s> <s>And that Socrates had the face of an animal and that land inspectors stammer." said the abbé.</s></p>
<p><s>"That is amazing capriciousness ," added Antonín, "Is it impossible to establish a type once and for all?"</s></p>
<C The Magician's Debate with Mrs Dùra>
<p><s>Meanwhile, Kateøina, who no longer needed to be in the ladies section, came along, dragging a bucket of slops.When she had emptied it out she joined in the convesration.</s></p>
<p><s>"This summer is not very amazing.</s> <s>Yesterday it rained and if Iam not mistaken, it will rain again today.Do you have such miserable weather in the Netherlands, sir?"</s></p>
<p><s>"It's a bit better, answered Arnoštek, "but on Sundays , it was, likewise, rainy.</s> <s>It starts raining about ten o'clock and goes on until midday.</s> <s>Then it clears up and all the townsfolk come running to the performance, for in that neck of the woods folk are really keen on education."</s></p>
<p><s>"Let's see," said the lady, putting down her bucket, "aren't there any exceptions to that rule.</s> <s>Are there really no bathing pool managers in the Netherlands, who wouldn't do a roaring trade as soon as the weather cleared up?</s> <s>How could you afford it, how could you be allowed, taking in to account all the losses you would incur as result from doing that, to abandon your bathing pools?</s> <s>My husband wouldn't go.</s> <s>My husband wouldn't go, not even if they were beating out the last judgment on a drum.</s> <s>My husband is a money grubber!"</s></p>
<p><s>The magician opined that this was reprehensible and the lady agreed.</s></p>
<p><s>"That's it!</s> <s>That's it!.</s> <s>I never cease repeating it dauy oin and day out.</s> <s>But you peobably know ythe reason that has caused it all?"</s></p>
<p><s>He has lived to fifty without ever leaving Krokovy Vary, he can read and write without hardly any difficulty, but mainly his education has been physical training, since he never stops physical training not even oin the evening when it's time to go to sleep."</s></p>
<p><s>"There," said Arnoštek, "is the stumbling block.</s> <s>I wouldn't mind betting that he does his physical exercises just like that, without any spiritual feeling, to his own detriment and to the benefit of an unhealthy passion to earn.</s></p>
