<T Havel>
<p><s>Václav Havel grew up in a well-known entrepreneurial and intellectual family, which was closely linked to the cultural and political events in Czechoslovakia from the 1920's to the 1940's.</s> <s>Because of these links the communists did not allow Havel to study formally after having completed required schooling in 1951.</s> <s>In the first part of the 1950's, a young Václav Havel entered into a four-year apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory assistant and simultaneously took evening classes to complete his secondary education (which he did in 1954).</s> <s>For political reasons he was not accepted into any post-secondary school with a humanities program; therefore, he opted to study at the Faculty of Economics of Czech Technical University.</s> <s>He left this program after two years.</s></p>
<p><s>The intellectual tradition of his family compelled Václav Havel to pursue the humanitarian values of Czech culture, which were harshly suppressed in the 1950's.</s> <s>Following his return from two years of military service, he worked as a stage technician - first at Divadlo ABC, and then, in 1960, at Divadlo Na zabradli.</s> <s>From 1962 until 1966, he studied Drama by correspondence at the Faculty of Theatre of the Academy of Musical Arts, and completed his studies with a commentary on the play "Eduard", which became the basis of his own "The Increased Difficulty of Concentration".</s></p>
<p><s>From the age of twenty years, Václav Havel published a number of studies and articles in various literary and theatrical periodicals.</s> <s>His first works were presented at the Divadlo Na zabradli; amongst these was the play "The Garden Party" (1963).</s> <s>It soon became a component of the revivalist tendencies of Czechoslovak society in the 1960's.</s> <s>This civic self-awareness culminated in the historic Prague Spring of 1968.</s> <s>During this time Havel not only produced other plays, such as "The Memorandum" (1965) and "The Increased Difficulty of Concentration" (1968), but was also the chair of the Club of Independent Writers and a member of the Club of [Politically] Engaged Non-Partisans.</s> <s>From 1965, he worked at the non- Marxist monthly Tvar.</s></p>
<p><s>In 1956, he became acquainted with Olga Splichalova, and their diverse family backgrounds attracted them to each other.</s> <s>After an eight-year acquaintance, they married.</s> <s>From that point on, Olga would accompany Václav through the most difficult experiences of their lives.</s> <s>The future President would later refer to her as his indispensable source of support.</s></p>
<p><s>Following the suppression of the Prague Spring by the invasion of the armies of the Warsaw Pact, Havel stood against the political repression characterized by the years of the so-called communist "normalization".</s> <s>In 1975, he wrote an open letter to President Husak, in which he warned of the accumulated antagonism in Czechoslovak society.</s> <s>The culmination of his activities resulted in Charter 77.</s> <s>Published in January of 1977, it embodied the character of the Czechoslovak population which silently protested against the communist government and resultant oppression, as well as providing a name for the movement.</s> <s>Václav Havel was one of the founders of this initiative, and one of its first three spokesmen.</s> <s>In April, 1979, he became a co-founder of the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted.</s> <s>He was imprisoned three times for his civic views, and spent nearly five years behind bars.</s></p>
<p><s>During this time, Czechoslovak authorities made it impossible to publish any of Havel's texts.</s> <s>Under the guidance of Havel's former literary agent, Klaus Juncker, the German publishing company Rowohlt, based in Reinbek near Hamburg, compliled a nearly complete publication of Havel's works.</s></p>
<p><s>In the second half of the 1980's, at a time of increasing dialogue between the Soviet Union and the Western Democracies, there was an perceptible increase in open dissatisfaction with the government in Czechoslovak society.</s> <s>The citizens became less willing to accept the repressive policies of the communist regime, which was seen in the willingness to sign the petition of "A Few Sentences", of which Havel was one of the authors.</s> <s>Whereas Charter 77 had only a few hundred signatories, ten thousand Czechoslovaks signed the Petition.</s></p>
<p><s>The beginning of social change began with a peaceful demonstration of students on November 17, 1989, on the occasion of the closure of Czechoslovak post-secondary schools by the occupying Nazis.</s> <s>The communist regime's police force brutally suppressed this demonstration on Narodni Trida in Prague.</s> <s>Students and Artists came to the forefront of subsequent civic uprisings.</s> <s>The meeting of the Drama Club of November 19th gave rise to Civic Forum, which became an umbrella group for organizations and individuals who demanded fundamental changes in the Czechoslovak political system.</s> <s>From its inception, Václav Havel became its leading figure.</s> <s>The social upheaval came to a climax on December 29th, 1989, when Václav Havel, as the candidate of Civic Forum, was elected President by the Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia.</s> <s>In his inaugural address, he promised to lead the nation to free elections, which he fulfilled in the summer of 1990.</s> <s>He was elected to the Czechoslovak Presidency a second time by the Federal Assembly on the 5th of July the same year.</s></p>
<p><s>Due to his unyielding political stance through the years of communist totality, Václav Havel became a recognized moral authority.</s> <s>The depth of his perception of the problems of civilization and his contemplation of their formulation enabled him to become very well- respected, even in the framework of his new function as Head of State, and outstanding amongst politicians.</s></p>
<p><s>During the course of his second term in office as President of the Czech and Slovak Federation, however, a rift between the Czech and Slovak political representatives over the future organization of the state began to emerge.</s> <s>Václav Havel was a determined supporter of a common Federation of Czechs and Slovaks, and always used his political influence to promote it.</s> <s>After the July 1992 parliamentary elections, the strongest contingents failed to agree on a functional model of the Federation and, as a direct result of this, the rift between Czech and Slovak political factions widened and failed to provide Havel with the required number of votes in the presidential elections of July 3, 1992.</s> <s>According to Czechoslovak law, he was able to remain President for a period of time, which stretched to July 20, when, due to his inability to fulfill his oath of loyalty to the Republic in such a manner to be in line with his conviction, disposition, and conscience, he resigned the Presidency.</s></p>
<p><s>After leaving office, Havel retired from public life for a while.</s> <s>In mid-November 1992, during a time when the onset of an independent Czech state was imminent, he confirmed that he would be seeking the Presidency.</s> <s>The official nomination of his candidacy was submitted on January 18, 1993 by four political parties of the ruling coalition government.</s> <s>On January 26, 1993, the Chamber of Deputies elected Václav Havel to be the first President of the independent Czech Republic.</s></p>
<p><s>Olga Havlova dedicated her time primarily to charitable activities.</s> <s>Inspired by the work of the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted, she founded the Goodwill Foundation in 1990, whose activities were directed at helping the mentally and physically handicapped.</s> <s>She died in 1996 after a severe, prolonged illness.</s></p>
<p><s>The end of 1996 dealt Havel another blow - a serious medical condition in his lungs.</s> <s>Early detection and quick, radical action on the part of his physicians were decisive in a successful recovery.</s> <s>His source of support in this time of trouble took the form of his friend Dagmar Veskrnova, whom the President married shortly after his release from hospital in January 1997.</s></p>
<p><s>Under difficult political circumstances, he was re-elected to the Presidency by both Chambers of Parliament on January 20, 1998.</s></p>
<p><s>For his literary and dramatic works, for his lifelong efforts and opinions, and for his position on the upholding of human rights, Václav Havel is the recipient of a number of state decorations, international awards and honorary doctorates.</s></p>
<T Charta>
<p><s>In the Czechoslovak Collection of Laws, no.</s> <s>120 of 13 October 1976, texts were published of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which were signed on behalf of our Republic in 1968, were confirmed at Helsinki in 1975 and came into force in our country on 23 March 1976.</s> <s>From that date our citizens have the right, and our state the duty, to abide by them.</s></p>
<p><s>The human rights and freedoms underwritten by these covenants constitute important assets of civilised life for which many progressive movements have striven throughout history and whose codification could greatly contribute to the development of a humane society.</s> <s>We accordingly welcome the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic's accession to those agreements.</s></p>
<p><s>Their publication, however, serves as an urgent reminder of the extent to which basic human rights in our country exist, regrettably, on paper only.</s></p>
<p><s>The right to freedom of expression, for example, guaranteed by article 19 of the first-mentioned covenant, is in our case purely illusory.</s> <s>Tens of thousands of our citizens are prevented from working in their own fields for the sole reason that they hold views differing from official ones, and are discriminated against and harassed in all kinds of ways by the authorities and public organisations.</s> <s>Deprived as they are of any means to defend themselves, they become victims of a virtual apartheid.</s></p>
<p><s>Hundreds of thousands of other citizens are denied that 'freedom from fear' mentioned in the preamble to the first covenant, being condemned to live in constant danger of unemployment or other penalties if they voice their own opinions.</s></p>
<p><s>In violation of article 13 of the second-mentioned covenant, guaranteeing everyone the right to education, countless young people are prevented from studying because of their own views or even their parents'.</s> <s>Innumerable citizens live in fear that their own or their children's right to education may be withdrawn if they should ever speak up in accordance with their convictions.</s></p>
<p><s>Any exercise of the right to 'seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print' or 'in the form of art', specified in article 19, para.</s> <s>2 of the first covenant, is punished by extrajudicial or even judicial sanctions, often in the form of criminal charges as in the recent trial of young musicians.</s></p>
<p><s>Freedom of public expression is repressed by the centralised control of all the communications media and of publishing and cultural institutions.</s> <s>No philosophical, political or scientific view or artistic expression that departs ever so slightly from the narrow bounds of official ideology or aesthetics is allowed to be published; no open criticism can be made of abnormal social phenomena; no public defence is possible against false and insulting charges made in official propaganda; the legal protection against 'attacks on honour and reputation' clearly guaranteed by article 17 of the first covenant is in practice non-existent; false accusations cannot be rebutted and any attempt to secure compensation or correction through the courts is futile; no open debate is allowed in the domain of thought and art.</s> <s>Many scholars, writers, artists and others are penalised for having legally published or expressed, years ago, opinions which are condemned by those who hold political power today.</s></p>
<p><s>Freedom of religious confession, emphatically guaranteed by article 18 of the first covenant, is systematically curtailed by arbitrary official action; by interference with the activity of churchmen, who are constantly threatened by the refusal of the state to permit them the exercise of their functions, or by the withdrawal of such permission; by financial or other measures against those who express their religious faith in word or action; by constraints on religious training and so forth.</s></p>
<p><s>One instrument for the curtailment or, in many cases, complete elimination of many civic rights is the system by which all national institutions and organisations are in effect subject to political directives from the apparatus of the ruling party and to decisions made by powerful individuals.</s> <s>The constitution of the Republic, its laws and other legal norms do not regulate the form or content, the issuing or application of such decisions; they are often only given out verbally, unknown to the public at large and beyond its powers to check; their originators are responsible to no one but themselves and their own hierarchy; yet they have a decisive impact on the actions of the lawmaking and executive organs of government, and of justice, of the trade unions, interest groups and all other organisations, of the other political parties, enterprises, factories, institutions, offices, schools, and so on, for whom these instructions have precedence even before the law.</s> <s>Where organisations or individual citizens, in the interpretation of their rights and duties, come into conflict with such directives, they cannot have recourse to any non-party authority, since none such exists.</s> <s>This constitutes, of course, a serious limitation of the right ensuing from articles 21 and 22 of the first-mentioned covenant, which provides for freedom of association and forbids any restriction on its exercise, from article 25 on the equal right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, and from article 26 stipulating equal protection by the law without discrimination.</s> <s>This state of affairs likewise prevents workers and others from exercising the unrestricted right to establish trade unions and other organisations to protect their economic and social interests, and from freely enjoying the right to strike provided for in para. 1 of article 8 in the second-mentioned covenant.</s></p>
<p><s>Further civic rights, including the explicit prohibition of 'arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence' (article 17 of the first covenant), are seriously vitiated by the various forms of interference in the private life of citizens exercised by the Ministry of the Interior, for example, by bugging telephones and houses, opening mail, following personal movements, searching homes, setting up networks of neighbourhood informers (often recruited by illicit threats or promises) and in other ways.</s> <s>The ministry frequently interferes in employers' decisions, instigates acts of discrimination by authorities and organisations, brings weight to bear on the organs of Justice and even orchestrates propaganda campaigns in the media.</s> <s>This activity is governed by no law and, being clandestine, affords the citizen no chance to defend himself.</s></p>
<p><s>In cases of prosecution on political grounds the investigative and judicial organs violate the rights of those charged and of those defending them, as guaranteed by article 14 of the first covenant and indeed by Czechoslovak law.</s> <s>The prison treatment of those sentenced in such cases is an affront to human dignity and a menace to their health, being aimed at breaking their morale.</s></p>
<p><s>Paragraph 2, article 12 of the first covenant, guaranteeing every citizen the right to leave the country, is consistently violated, or under the pretence of 'defence of national security' is subjected to various unjustifiable conditions (para.</s> <s>3).</s> <s>The granting of entry visas to foreigners is also handled arbitrarily, and many are unable to visit Czechoslovakia merely because of professional or personal contacts with those of our citizens who are subject to discrimination.</s></p>
<p><s>Some of our people -- either in private, at their places of work or by the only feasible public channel, the foreign media -- have drawn attention to the systematic violation of human rights and democratic freedoms and demanded amends in specific cases.</s> <s>But their pleas have remained largely ignored or been made grounds for police investigation.</s></p>
<p><s>Responsibility for the maintenance of civic rights in our country naturally devolves in the first place on the political and state authorities.</s> <s>Yet, not only on them: everyone bears his share of responsibility for the conditions that prevail and accordingly also for the observance of legally enshrined agreements, binding upon all citizens as well as upon governments.</s></p>
<p><s>It is this sense of co-responsibility, our belief in the meaning of voluntary citizens' involvement and the general need to give it new and more effective expression that led us to the idea of creating Charter 77, whose inception we today publicly announce.</s></p>
<p><s>Charter 77 is a free informal, open community of people of different convictions, different faiths and different professions united by the will to strive, individually and collectively, for the respect of civic and human rights in our own country and throughout the world -- rights accorded to all men by the two mentioned international covenants, by the Final Act of the Helsinki conference and by numerous other international documents opposing war, violence and social or spiritual oppression, and which are comprehensively laid down in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</s></p>
<p><s>Charter 77 springs from a background of friendship and solidarity among people who share our concern for those ideals that have inspired, and continue to inspire, their lives and their work.</s></p>
<p><s>Charter 77 is not an organisation; it has no rules.</s> <s>permanent bodies or formal membership.</s> <s>It embraces everyone who agrees with its ideas, participates in its work, and supports it.</s></p>
<p><np><s>It does not form the basis for any oppositional political activity.</s> <s>Like manv similar citizen initiatives in various countries, West and East, it seeks to promote the general public interest.</s> <s>It does not aim, then, to set out its own programmes for political or social reforms or changes, but within its own sphere of activity it wishes to conduct a constructive dialogue with the political and state authorities, particularly by drawing attention to various individual cases where human and civil rights are violated, by preparing documentation and suggesting solutions, by submitting other proposals of a more general character aimed at reinforcing such rights and their guarantees, and by acting as a mediator in various conflict situations which may lead to injustice and so forth.</s></p>
<p><s>By its symbolic name Charter 77 denotes that it has come into being at the start of a year proclaimed as the Year of Political Prisoners, a year in which a conference in Belgrade is due to review the implementation of the obligations assumed at Helsinki.</s></p>
<p><s>As signatories, we hereby authorise Professor Dr Jan Patocka, Vaclav Havel and Professor Jiri Hajek to act as the spokesmen for the Charter.</s> <s>These spokesmen are endowed with full authority to represent it vis-a-vis state and other bodies.</s> <s>and the public at home and abroad, and their signatures attest the authenticity of documents issued by the Charter.</s> <s>They will have us, and others who join us, as their co-workers, taking part in any needful negotiations, shouldering particular tasks and sharing every responsibility.</s></p>
<p><s>We believe that Charter 77 will help to enable all the citizens of Czechoslovakia to work and live as free human beings.</s></p>
<T Penicilin>
<C Introduction>
<p><s>Recent years have seen widespread commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of Fleming's discovery of penicillin along with the fortieth anniversary of its chemical isolation and the start of its manufacture as one of the most successful anti-microbial drugs ever.</s> <s>There may therefore seem to be little point in recalling the particular history of the drug in one small country, especially one whose significance had little impact on the wider world.</s> <s>The manufacture of and treatment with penicillin in Czechoslovakia is doubtless a minor episode in the context of the world history of its discovery, production and therapeutic application; on the other hand, it is such a unique episode and so different from how it was introduced in any other country that I believe a summary history of it is warranted.</s> <s>The more justly so given that those directly involved and other first-hand witnesses are slowly disappearing.</s> <s>Additionally, there are the specific features – no less interesting for the history of medicine – of the experimental work which, inspired by the discovery of penicillin and carried out in the difficult conditions of working underground under Nazi occupation, finally led to the preparation of a drug which, if not identical to penicillin, was analogous to it.</s> <s>This in turn added uniquely interesting features to the systematic introduction of treatment with the penicillin supplied after the war by UNRRA, and ultimately to the launch of industrial manufacture, likewise facilitated by supplies from the same post-war aid organisation.</s></p>
<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>By way of introduction to this section, it is doubtless proper to recall that the work did have a particular domestic tradition behind it: First, there is the systematic use of microbial products of pyocyanea (?) bacillus (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in medical practice.</s> <s>As early as 1898, Professor I.</s> <s>Honl published with Bukovský the undoubtedly successful results arising from the treatment of festering leg ulcers; these results even led to the production of tablets ('anginolky') that were recommended for the local treatment of anginas, especially streptococcal.</s> <s>Nor did Fleming's 1929 discovery of penicillin pass without an echo: on water cultures sent in for purity testing, F.</s> <s>Pato?ka succeeded in capturing an antibiotic coccoid organism which he called Polycoccus honli, having failed to classify it systematically among the known coccoid organisms.</s> <s>While still a medical student, I was invited by Pato?ka to join in the experimental work with this organism, which produced antibiotic agents effective against the grampositive microbes – especially streptococci and Bac.</s> <s>anthracis – that were used for the titration of its effect.</s> <s>By then (1930) it had become possible to isolate the agent and determine its chemistry; all I recall is that I achieved a roughly tenfold concentration of the agent from the filtrate by adsorption onto aluminium oxide and active charcoal.</s></p>
<p><s>The opportunities for work on isolation were quite different by the time we learned (during the Occupation, when all contacts with scientists in the West were sundered), from the last literature to arrive and from radio reports, of the successful isolation of penicillin and its miraculous effects.</s></p>
<p><s>Before moving on to my own experimental work, I must described the situation at the time to illustrate the conditions in which we worked.</s></p>
<p><s>The universities had been closed and with them their laboratories, unless they had been transferred in time to the health service.</s> <s>For example, the pathological anatomy labs continued to be used for dissection at the General (University) Hospital; the laboratories of the University's Institute of Bacteriology became part of the system of the State Institute of Public Health, functioning primarily as an epidemiological testing station, while continuing to function as a bacteriological diagnostic station for the various surviving clinics.</s> <s>Under these circumstances, many university lecturers were unable to work in their disciplines, but, as far as possible, they were assigned to health service facilities that were closest to their own fields.</s> <s>In order to make full use of their expertise, leading pharmaceutical companies – all Czech – took them on at least as scientific consultants if they failed to employ them as fully-fledged specialist employees.</s> <s>Thus were places found not only for lecturers, but also for students, thereby saving many, in Nazi eyes 'suspicious', elements from forced redeployment elsewhere; everything depended, of course, on the courage and bravery of company managers.</s> <s>Not only did industry itself benefit hugely from this – from the boost given to the standard of its experimental work – but no less significant was the fact that the continuity of academic experimental work was maintained, at least in part.</s> <s>In certain spheres, such as experimental pharmacology and some areas of physiology and organic chemistry, the groundwork was laid, and the chance of enhancing their qualifications provided, for future university lecturers.</s></p>
<p><s>In this manner, high-powered – for the age – laboratories came into being inter al.</s> <s>at BF Fragner Pharmaceuticals in M?cholupy near Prague, thanks chiefly to the company's founder, proprietor and director, Dr J.</s> <s>Fragner, who was a highly educated, science-minded company organiser, with a gift for initiative.</s> <s>It was at these laboratories that that important feat – the successful attempt to produce penicillin in-house – was achieved.</s></p>
<p><s>As noted above, the impulse came from the very fragmentary reports from England of the successful isolation and positively miraculous effects of penicillin.</s> <s>I can no longer recall whose initiative it was, but I think it came from the young employees – students – P.</s> <s>Fragner in particular, who was already attracted to mycology and who later devoted his entire post-war career to it.</s> <s>From various substrates, but chiefly from the compost left by laboratory rabbits, they tried to isolate strains corresponding to that described by Fleming.</s> <s>From a fairly large number (they cite 74) of isolates, they indeed managed to acquire strains that were unequivocally antibiotic and also approached the description of penicillin-producers, especially in having the familiar yellow pigmentation of the colonies.</s></p>
<p><s>It was then that I was approached, sometime in early 1943, by Dr Fragner for my advice: should he support and finance these attempts to isolate the antibiotic?</s> <s>My view was that even if the experiment was an unqualified success, the company could not expect production to be profitable, since it had to be assumed that in post-war conditions, after the defeat of Germany, industrial production of penicillin would be so advanced that we would not be able to compete.</s> <s>However, I recommended that the experiments should continue, since the expertise gained from them would be an incalculable asset when it came to mastering that which would have been acquired in the meantime abroad.</s> <s>Dr Fragner made this view his own and gave his unstinting moral and financial support to the experiments.</s> <s>It was a courageous decision, not only in material terms (let it not be forgotten that this was wartime and raw materials were hard to come by), but also because we had decided, for obvious reasons, to work in absolute secrecy, lest any success we had be exploited by the occupying Nazis, who were known to be trying, and in several laboratories at once, to develop penicillin production themselves; so far they had failed, though their resources were vastly superior.</s> <s>As it transpired, our view and the decision based on it were right: although the experiments were successful, there was no possibility of independently developing them further after the war, but the experience gained, not only in the lab and in production, but also in therapy, came into its own when penicillin production in Czechoslovakia came to be set up and treatment with penicillin became organised, the conditions having been created thanks to supplies from UNRRA.</s></p>
<T Radio>
<p><s>The first attempts at radio broadcasting in Czechoslovakia began after the First World War.</s> <s>The first radio programme, made up of words and music, was broadcast on the first anniversary of the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia on October 28th, 1919, from the telegraph station at Prague's Petrin lookout tower.</s></p>
<p><s>Regular radio broadcasts began on May 18th 1923, from a military tent in Prague-Kbely, making Czechoslovakia the second European country after the UK to have regular radio broadcasting.</s> <s>The long-wave broadcasts at first lasted just one hour per day and consisted of a brief lead-in and a concert.</s></p>
<p><s>The country's broadcasting pioneers were the journalist Milos Ctrnacty, the businessman Eduard Svoboda, and Ladislav Sourek, director of Radioslavia - the company that distributed radio receivers.</s> <s>These three men created a limited-liability company called Radiojournal, which was majority owned by Radioslavia.</s> <s>Radiojournal became Czechoslovakia's first radio operator after receiving permission from the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs.</s> <s>Milos Ctrnacty became its programme director, Alois Svoboda the technical director.</s> <s>The main source of revenue for Radiojournal were subscriptions - regular fees paid by owners of radio receivers.</s> <s>The first subscriber enlisted in September 1923.</s> <s>Radiojournal organised public listening session in Prague in order to promote radio broadcasting and attract new subscribers.</s> <s>In 1923 the company also started publishing a monthly called Radiojournal informing about radio broadcasting.</s></p>
<p><s>January 1924 saw the first broadcasting intended for listeners abroad in English and Esperanto.</s> <s>In May the same year the Czech equivalent of the word "broadcasting" ("rozhlas") was coined and began to replace such expressions as "radiophony" and even the English expression "broadcasting".</s> <s>In December 1924, Radiojournal moved from the tent in Prague-Kbely into a building owned by the post office at Foch Street (today's Vinohradska Street) in the centre of Prague.</s></p>
<p><s>In 1925, Radiojournal broadcast the first live transmission of a concert of the Czech Philharmonic, the first live transmission of a church service and the first live transmission of president T.</s> <s>G.</s> <s>Masaryk's speech.</s> <s>Many different nationalities lived in Czechoslovakia back then, so Radiojournal started broadcasting for the German, Hungarian and Ruthenian minorities.</s> <s>Revenues from the subscription fees failed to cover the costs and provide the necessary funds for further development.</s> <s>In 1925, the state gained a majority share in Radiojournal via the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs.</s></p>
<p><s>The year 1926 saw the introduction of several novelties, such as the time signal and regular news bulletins that were produced by Czechoslovak Press Agency.</s> <s>The first radio drama appeared.</s> <s>New radio stations opened in Brno and Bratislava.</s> <s>In 1926, a Radiojournal orchestra was established and later developed into the Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra as we know it today.</s> <s>Another two stations - Ostrava and Kosice - started broadcasting in the late 1920's.</s></p>
<p><s>The 1930's was a "golden era" for pre-war radio.</s> <s>The number of subscribers was growing constantly to reach one million in 1937.</s> <s>The programme included practically all genres, from educational programmes to sport reports, from classical music to cabaret.</s> <s>The station also offered short programmes in Esperanto, English and German intended for listeners abroad.</s> <s>Various technical inventions contributed to the development of radio broadcasting.</s> <s>One of them was a predecessor of today's tape recorder, blatnerphone, which recorded sound on a steel tape.</s> <s>At the end of 1933 the station was given a permanent headquarters at 12 Foch Street (today's Vinohradska Street) where it has remained to this day.</s></p>
<p><s>In the 1930s some European countries (Great Britain, Germany, Russia) started broadcasting on short wave.</s> <s>With the war approaching they tried to win foreign listeners over for their political standpoints.</s> <s>Czechoslovakia, too, responded to that propaganda.</s> <s>On August 31, 1936, the Radiojournal company launched its short-wave broadcasts for audiences abroad.</s> <s>It broadcast in five languages four hours a day.</s> <s>By the end of the 1930s the volume of broadcasts increased several times.</s></p>
<p><s>After the occupation of Czechoslovakia and the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in 1939, the radio was subject to the protectorate authorities and all employees of Jewish origin were forced to leave.</s> <s>The short-wave international service was limited to a two-hour broadcast in the Czech language.</s> <s>During the Second World War, programmes were broadcast to Bohemia from Moscow, Washington and London, which was the seat of the Czechoslovak exile government.</s> <s>Listening to those broadcasts in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was a crime punishable by severe sentences.</s></p>
<p><s>On May 5, 1945, a call to arms broadcast on the radio started the Prague Uprising.</s> <s>The following battles in the surroundings of the radio building claimed many lives and the building itself was severely damaged.</s> <s>After the war, the international service broadcasting on short wave resumed.</s> <s>The news was not written by the Czechoslovak Press Agency like before the war but the news bulletins were produced by Czechoslovak Radio itself.</s></p>
<p><s>After the communist takeover in 1948, Czechoslovak Radio was nationalised.</s> <s>For the next forty years the media in Czechoslovakia were to serve "the people and the Communist Party".</s> <s>In 1948 the international MEVRO radio exhibition took place in Prague where the first Czechoslovak television set was displayed.</s></p>
<p><s>The 1950s reflect the escalating war of ideologies and also technical progress.</s> <s>Czechoslovak Radio broadcast on two nationwide stations - Prague and Bratislava, new transmitters were built, new regional stations opened.</s> <s>In 1952 Czechoslovak Radio started jamming the broadcasts of Radio Free Europe.</s> <s>An authority called the Main Board of Press Supervision was established to play the role of a censor.</s> <s>In 1953 Czech Television started its broadcasts.</s> <s>Until 1957 television broadcasting was part of Czechoslovak Radio.</s> <s>At the beginning of the 1960s Czechoslovak Radio started FM broadcasting in the 60-80 MHz band.</s></p>
<p><s>In the 1960s the political climate became more liberal, a situation in which Czechoslovak media could thrive.</s> <s>This liberal period was forcibly ended by the invasion of the Warsaw Pact armies on the 21st of August 1968.</s> <s>There was another battle of Czechoslovak Radio similar to the one at the end of the Second World War.</s> <s>Fifteen Prague citizens and radio employees lost their lives in a battle with Soviet armed forces who eventually seized the building, but radio broadcasting continued from other locations.</s> <s>Regular broadcasting from the Czechoslovak Radio building resumed on September 9, 1968.</s> <s>In the following period, also known as the "normalisation", hundreds of employees were forced to leave the radio because of their political views.</s></p>
<p><s>In 1970 a nationwide station called "Hvezda" or "Star" was established bringing news 24 hours a day.</s> <s>The same year saw a continuing proliferation of stereo technology in FM broadcasts.</s> <s>In 1972 a nationwide station "Vltava" was launched focusing on classical music and radio drama.</s> <s>At the same time a five-hour music and news programme in five languages called "Interprogramme Radio Prague" was introduced.</s> <s>It was intended for foreigners living in Czechoslovakia and neighbouring countries.</s> <s>The 1970s saw a boom of short-wave broadcasts by Radio Prague.</s> <s>Programmes in ten languages were broadcast 37 hours a day.</s></p>

<C January>
<p><s>Newly-appointed prime minister Josef Tosovsky announced the names of the new government's ministers on December 30 of last year.</s> <s>The minister without portfolio and the cabinet's spokesman is the former editor-in-chief of the weekly newspaper Respekt, Vladimir Mlynar.</s> <s>He thus also took on the duties of chairman of the Council for Nationalities as well as the Inter-Ministerial Commission for Concerns of Romani Citizens.</s></p>
<p><s>The much-discussed vice-chairwoman of this commission, which was created by decision of the government of former prime minister Vaclav Klaus after the departure of many Roma to Great Britain last year, became psychologist Monika Horakova.</s> <s>At the beginning of January, the six members of the commission met at the Office of the Government and agreed on their division of the individual specialist groups.</s> <s>Journalist Petr Uhl terminated his membership in the commission, with the justification that Bratinka's authority had been actually taken over by Vladimir Mlynar.</s> <s>He didn't specify his reservations with Mlynar.</s></p>
<p><s>"The most relevant task is the calling of the commission.</s> <s>We would further like , in cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior, to resolve the problems of the Roma - those that returned from Canada, England and other countries," said Monika Horakova in presenting the commission's first steps.</s> <s>She herself wants to look into the liquidation of the pig farm in Lety u Pisku which stands on the site of a concentration camp for Roma, a step completely supported by Mlynar.</s></p>
<C Meeting of Educators of Romani Children in Ostrava>
<p><s>On January 16, a two-day meeting began in Ostrava of educators of Romani children, Romologists, and representatives of the Ministry of Education, at which was discussed the possibilities of arranging a system of elementary education from which Romani children wouldn't be excluded.</s> <s>One co-organizer of the meeting is also the director of the parochial elementary and nursey school Premysl Pitter in Ostrava, Helena Balabanova, whose school is attended by the majority of Romani children who would otherwise "end up" in special schools.</s></p>
<p><s>According to Director Balabanova, 50 to 60 percent of Romani children actually attend special schools.</s> <s>"Schools in the suburbs, where a lot of Roma live, need a special concept, modified to the Roma and their mentality," said Balabanova, who spoke at the conference of her practical experience in the education of Roma.</s> <s>At the seminar, where about twenty contributions were heard, all the participants spoke of the need for speedy changes in the system of elementary and special education so that it pulls in the most Romani students.</s></p>
<p><s>The participants in the conference also sent to the Minister of Education, Jan Sokol, with a request for the promised two million Czech crowns (roughly $65,000) to pay for teaching assistants in selected schools to aid in the education of Romani children.</s> <s>At the time of the meeting, 19 of them were already working in Czech schools in Usti nad Labem, Prague, Brno, and Ostrava, thanks to financial support from the New School and Helsinki Citizen's Assembly foundations and the PHARE program.</s></p>
<p><s>Also on January 16, Minister Vladimir Mlynar came to Ostrava, to get more closely acquainted with the situation of the Ostrava Roma.</s> <s>He visited the Premysl Pitter parochial elementary and nursey school, and met with representatives of the Ostrava city council as well as with representatives of Romani organizations.</s> <s>He said that during his visit he spoke only generally about what should be done by the state, the city, and the Romani community for the Roma who return from seeking political asylum in Canada and Great Britain and will be in dire financial straits.</s> <s>He also said during his vist to Ostrava that the government was preparing amendments to laws that should help to lower the high rate of unemployment among the Roma.</s></p>
<C Arson Attack on a Romani Family in Krnov>
<p><s>Fire ravaged a Romani family's one-room apartment in Krnov in the early morning hours of January 17 after unknown assailants threw a molotov cocktail into the flat.</s> <s>Of the five Roma sleeping in the room where the bottle landed, one of them, Emilie Zigova, suffered serious burns, and the flat sustained damages of approximately 100,000 crowns.</s></p>
<p><s>An hour after the arson attack, someone set fire to a foreign-made car belonging to another Roma on the other side of Krnov.</s> <s>The police began to search for the perpetrators and also increased patrols at the homes of Roma in the area.</s> <s>"If the Roma agree, we'll install wire netting or strong shutters on their windows.</s> <s>We'll also request money from the Ministry of the Interior for a monitoring system and police cameras placed at the most critical spots," said Krnova mayor Bedrich Marek.</s></p>
<p><s>"It's a good solution.</s> <s>But everything will be in vain if people's behavior doesn't change," said League for Human Rights in Krnov representative Josef Balaz.</s> <s>"We're scared, because it could be repeated at any time.</s> <s>This time we managed to escape, but we're afraid that next time we won't be able to get away from the flames," said Milan Kovac about the attack which cost his family their home.</s></p>
<p><s>Kovac had apparently already been critical of the Krnov authorities, for refusing to provide the family with a larger apartment.</s> <s>"They don't care about us because we're Roma.</s> <s>If we were white, nobody would allow us to live in such conditions.</s> <s>After the fire, it's now even more unbearable, because we all have to sleep on two beds," said Milan Kovac's son.</s></p>
<p><s>The deputy mayor of Krnov, Vladimir Vocelka, rejected the criticism, saying that the family still lives in emergency conditions because they didn't pay the town rent.</s> <s>The municipal administration, according to Vocelka, however, will do the most it can to help the stricken family.</s> <s>Krnov mayor Bedrich Marek promised that in one week he would secure for the large family a municipal flat into which they would be able to move.</s> <s>"Until that time, we will get them lodging in a boarding house," he said.</s></p>
<p><s>Josef Balaz of the Krnov League for the Human Rights of Roma added, that it also complicated the Kovacs' situation that they still had Slovak citizenship and therefore had no claim to anykind of social assistance or other state financial support.</s></p>
<p><s>The Kovac's have since received state assistance, food, clothes and blankets.</s> <s>"We will help arrange for their citizenship and with assistance from the Red Cross we are able to provide them with an apartment," said Jiri Skrabal, the head of the Dept.</s> <s>of Social Affairs in the regional office at Bruntala.</s> <s>The Krnov Roma were shaken by the attack, and decided to help the family by taking up a collection among themselves.</s> <s>Journalists in Ostrava had a similar idea, and set up an account for the financial assistance of the Kovac's.</s></p>
<p><s>The family concerned was visited as well by Minister Vladimir Mlynar, who came to deliver the government's financial aid on January 23.</s> <s>He described the attack as "cowardly and disgusting" and voiced the opinion to the Krnov town council that putting netting on their windows was not a way to protect Roma from racist attacks.</s> <s>"The solution is for Roma in the Czech Republic to feel just as safe as other residents," Mlynar said.</s> <s>He emphasized, that similar racist attacks cannot be allowed, although he admitted that the problems of racism, xenophobia, and neo-nazism can't be solved overnight.</s></p>
<p><s>The police have meanwhile had little success in their pursuit of suspects in the arson attack.</s> <s>"We're pursuing the perpetrators intensively and we've questioned over 60 people so far," said Milan Navratil, the Bruntal police chief.</s> <s>The police said that for now they have no proof that would confirm the suspiscion that it was an attack motivated by racial hatred.</s> <s>Vladimir Mlynar called on the Krnov Roma not to take the law into their own hands.</s> <s>For public endangerment and violence against a group of inhabitants and individuals, the perpetrators face up to 8 years in prison.</s></p>
<p><s>During his visit to Krnov, Minister Mlynar suggested that Roma also be employed with the Krnov police.</s> <s>"It could be helpful, because white policemen possibly have a somewhat different view of the dangers of these matters connected with racism than members of the ethnic group they deal with.</s> <s>I will meet about this with Interior Minister Cyril Svoboda," Mlynar said, and asked Roma to suggest to him the best candidates from their ranks for the police, so that he could deliver the list to the leadership of the Ministry of the Interior.</s> <s>"We (the government) are trying to look for the most ways possible how to help the Roma, though we have no miraculous solution.</s> <s>But the Roma have to become better organized and to speak to the state with a unified voice, so it can help them in some way," he added.</s></p>
<p><s>The Krnov Roma chose from among themselves a candidate to be the officer who would help the Roma community in their meetings with city offices.</s> <s>According to Krnov Mayor Bedrich Marek, this assistant could begin working in the Krnov town hall within three months.</s> <s>"This assistant won't be an employee of the town administration, but will be payed as an employee of the state," said the mayor.</s></p>
<C The Several Words Petition>
<p><s>At the end of January, the Several Words petition first emerged, in which it said that "Czech public broadcasting does not present all of our citizens and foreigners as a natural part of society."</s> <s>Television and radio, according to the petition, mostly indirectly invite the idea that if there is, for example, Romani representation only within the framework of segregated programs or as a problem on the news, then they don't belong in normal life anywhere other "than in the ghetto or somewhere the trouble comes from."</s></p>
<p><s>The signatories of the petition, among whom are Senate Chairman Petr Pithart, Deputy Pavel Dostal, sociologist Ivan Gabal, political scientist Fedor Gal, journalists and other citizens, are convinced that the public media should place its entire orientation towards the formation of a democratic society which acts with respect towards minorities and their identity.</s> <s>The signatories sent the text of the petition to Minister Vladimir Mlynar, the Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and the boards of Czech Television and Czech Radio.</s></p>
<C The Roma Minority in the Media>
<p><s>At the same time, the Focus agency released the results of its public opinion survey concerning the attitude of the Czech populace towards the Roma minority.</s> <s>The results of the study indicated that the Czech public is satisfied with the presentation of Romani problems in the media and doesn't care for more media attention to be directed toward the Roma.</s> <s>Two-thirds of the population are satisfied with the space devoted to the Roma in the media, while less than a fifth of respondents hold the opposite opinion.</s> <s>In fact, 59 percent of those polled felt that the media don't give objective information about the Roma and that, on the contrary, they side with the Roma.</s></p>
<p><s>Out of those who watch Czech public television, 57 percent are satisfied with the objectivity of the information presented about Roma, while only 45 percent of those who watch NOVA, the popular private station, are satisfied.</s> <s>The NOVA audience primarily criticize the tendency to stereotype Roma and thus to create a negative image of them or to use them as objects of jokes.</s></p>
<C The Government's Program Statement>
<p><s>After a two-day discussion, the government of Josef Tosovsky received a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies on January 28.</s> <s>The government came before the chamber with a program statement that (unlike that of previous cabinets) remembered to mention the Romani minority.</s></p>
<p><s>"The government considers the attitude of the state towards national minorities as one of the key priorities of its policy.</s> <s>It will especially press for a change in the approach of the majority populace towards the Roma minority, which has so far been governed by a number of hostile and xenophobic stereotypes, while also seeing to the speedy and lawful prosecution of any displays of discrimination or racism.</s> <s>The government also takes up the pledge of the previous cabinet to erect a dignified monument on the site of the former internment camp at Lety u Pisku."</s></p>
<p><s>Several deputies shared their opinions on this passage with Czech Radio.</s> <s>Michal Prokop of the ODA (Civic Democratic Alliance) considered it important that the Roma question received space in the document comparable to other departments.</s> <s>"It's very difficult in five months, which is evidently what the government has left, to realize concrete steps towards becoming a multicultural society, such as, for example, societyin the United States has been tending towards for 200 years already.</s> <s>But I perceive it as very important and, unlike a number of my colleagues, i consider the weakest part of it all the pledge to build the monument in Lety.</s> <s>Admittedly, it's an important symbol, but I consider as fundamentally more important the constructing of certain attitudes toward the Roma community in the area of education, of culture.</s> <s>These are the things which can then change the thinking of society and it won't happen in five months."</s></p>
<p><s>Republican Josef Krejsa, on the other hand, was literally offended by the government's statement: "The government isn't ashamed to raise prices at the present time, but it finds the money to build a monument to gypsies.</s> <s>It is simply rudeness and an insult to all white citizens of this state."</s></p>
<p><s>The situation, reflected in the racially-tinged remark of Kresla, won't be changed by some sentences in a government statement, according to Social Democratic deputy Pavel Dostal: "For every government that comes along, the Roma question becomes its problem, because the Roma problem in substance isn't the Roma's, but our problem.</s> <s>Without a complex solution and the cooperation of all departments, it isn't possible to solve this problem.</s> <s>But now it will depend on each department.</s> <s>how it marks out priorities in this sense."</s></p>
<C Delegates>
<p><s>On January 27, participants in the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg approved a report which pointed out that members of the Roma, as well as of other minorities, in Europe have poor conditions for acquiring higher education.</s> <s>Generally, minorities don't receive "enabling" elementary and intermediate education and the Roma's access to higher education, according to the Council of Europe deputies, is a hindered by their economic and social situation.</s> <s>The Assembly called on the member countries to attempt to improve this situation.</s></p>
<p><s>Romani delegates to the Victims of Nazism requested on Jan. 28 in a meeting with German government minister and chief of the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl for analogous compensation from the German government, as that secured by the international Jewish organization from Bonn for those afflicted by the Second World War.</s> <s>"It's not possible to make distinctions among groups of people liquidated during the Holocaust," said the Chairman of the Central Council of German Roma, Romani Rose.</s> <s>According to him, there are still about 200 Roma in Germany who have never received the monthly allowance offered to Jewish victims and others who suffered from the Nazi era.</s> <s>Minister Bohl rejected the Roma's claims in a press statement, however, saying that the Roma, just like other people persecuted by the Nazism, received some form of compensation.</s></p>
<C US State Dept. Report>
<p><s>A overall favorable report on the state of human rights in the Czech Republic was made public on Jan.30 by the U.S.</s> <s>State Department, which makes its observations on the state of human rights around the world regularly every year.</s> <s>The report for 1997 once again stated, same as in past years, that the Czech government generally respects human rights, but that widespread prejudice toward the Roma and attacks by skinheads on members of the Roma minority continue to be a problem.</s> <s>In spite of the reduced discriminatory impact of the law on Czech citizenship with the amendment of 1996, hundreds of Roma still remain without citizenship and they struggle with many obstacles in obtaining it.</s></p>
<p><s>Two to three hundred thousand Roma, said the document, suffer from poverty, violence, discrimination, illiteracy and disease.</s> <s>According to the report, unlike in previous years, greater attention is devoted to displays of racism and discrimination and the Czech media provides better information about the Roma than in the past as well.</s> <s>The report also mentioned the exodus of Roma to Canada and Great Britain, but didn't comment on it at all.</s></p>
<p><s>"The Americans have been repeating this for many years, but they don't see that what's lacking here is a rational, conceptual policy.</s> <s>Since the government does nothing at all in the questions of the Roma and racism, because it doesn't know how it should do it, it has no concept," said Martin Palous, chairman of the Czech Helsinki Committee, in reference to the U.S.</s> <s>State Dept.</s> <s>report.</s></p>
<C Meeting>
<p><s>On Jan 29, the Inter-Ministerial Commission for Concerns of the Roma Community met for the second time in 1998, to come to an agreement on its priorities, which it will submit to the state administration and individual ministries.</s> <s>The commission considers schooling and education of the Roma to be most important.</s> <s>The greatest problem, according to the commission, are the special-education schools, which 70 percent of Romani children attend.</s> <s>They get into them easily, but leave them with difficulty, stated the commission.</s> <s>It said that in practice, no case can be found of a Romani student managing to transfer from a special-education school to a normal school.</s> <s>The current system of education doesn't allow children to be educated in a satisfactory manner, and the possiblity for higher qualification closes for them there as well.</s> <s>The commission therefore acknowledged the great importance of preparatory classes, which could be the point of departure from the present unfair state of education of Romani children.</s></p>
<C February>
<p><s>On February 4, police arrested three youths they believe threw a molotov cocktail into the house of a Romani family in Krnov in the second half of January.</s> <s>"The investigator will make a decision on the case.</s> <s>It's premature to talk about whether the attack had a racial motive," said Bruntal police director Milan Navratil after the arrest of the youths, the youngest of which is less under 18.</s> <s>He also confirmed that all three belonged to the group of people known to the police for their extreme views, though criminologists didn't rule out the possibility that motive of the attack wasn't racial intolerance, but the settling of personal accounts.</s></p>
<p><s>A former member of this group of skinheads was a girl who was at the time of the attack the girlfriend of Milan Kovac's son and she was living with him in that house with his family.</s> <s>"The reason for the attack may even have been debts, and not only to the city," admitted the police, as the family was known for dodging payments - they are ten thousand crowns behind on their rent and six members of the family claim to live on the father's invalidity pension, the adult children don't work and they have yet to gain Czech citizenship.</s></p>
<p><s>It took two days for the police to figure out that the youths who had been in jail for the attack on the Romani family since February 5 actually sympathized with the skinhead movement.</s> <s>"The racial motive of the arson attack is clear.</s> <s>A search of the homes of all three was made and skinhead-related materials were found - various leaflets and letters with fascist subject matter.</s> <s>They are in any case connected with this movement," the head of investigators in Bruntalek, Zdenek Scerba, said.</s> <s>One of the youths had even been under investigation by the police for a number of months for a racially-motivated offense.</s></p>
<p><s>The Kovac family, in the meantime, was refusing to move out of their burned out apartment into a one-room replacement, since they were still asking the town for a three-room apartment.</s> <s>"Their attitude is creating anti-Roma feelings among people.</s> <s>People have the feeling that the Kovacs are trying to exploit thir misfortune for as much as they can," said Krnov Deputy Mayor Vladimir Vocelka.</s> <s>People were coming to the municipal offices to complain about offering an apartment to rent dodgers while twelve hundred residents of Krnov were waiting on the list for housing.</s> <s>The ire of many people has turned from the arsonists to their victims.</s> <s>"We've heard the opinion that it seves the Roma right.</s> <s>There are bad feelings here," said Ester Kotlarova of the League of Peace and Human Rights of Roma, which is trying to help the Kovacs and concedes that by dictating requirements for an apartment Kovac is making people angry.</s></p>
<C Law on Migration Cancelled>
<p><s>On February 4, parliamentary deputies met to cancel the law on the permanent settlement of migrating persons, as per the suggestion of the communist deputies, who considered it as "entirely dead."</s> <s>Communist deputy Zuzka Rujbrova said that when the law came into being its primary motivation was the attempt to coerce citizens of the Roma nationality to change their lifestyle and to persuade them to conform with the way of life of the other residents.</s></p>
<p><s>Republican deputy Zdenek Krampera agreed with the cancellation of this law, but at the same time he pushed for the adoption of all the legal norms of the First Republic, which, according to his explanation, very precisely designated and delineated the migration of"gypsies" and other persons.</s> <s>Krampera thus endorsed the adoption of a law on the survey, registration and inspection of migrating persons, for which Miroslav Vyborny of the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) labelled him a racist.</s> <s>Deputy Hana Orgonikova of the Social Democrats (CSSD), during the debate on the cancellation of the law, pointed out that a new law on migratory life would have to be prepared due to, for example, the provision of social support and health care, which were assessed according to a citizen's permanent residence.</s></p>
<C Roma Graduates>
<p><s>The first nineteen graduates of the Romani Social Law Academy on February 6 received certificates on the completion of the re-qualification course, in which they were qualified as Romani assistants and Romani advisors.</s> <s>The Academy's graduates entered the course on the recommendation of the Labor Office, where they were looking for work, and they will be working in regional offices.</s> <s>By government decree (LINK), beginning in autumn 1997 advisory positions were created for Romani assistants, who will help Roma in their communication with officials, and so far not even a third of these positions have been filled.</s></p>
<p><s>The positions of Romani Assistant and Romani Advisor call for Roma who have completed technical or preparatory secondary school or and in the course they acquire a basic knowledge from the sphere of law and social policy, they perfect their Czech, and they learn to work with computers.</s> <s>According to Minister Vladimir Mlynar, who took place in the ceremonial conferring of diplomas, the graduates of this re-qualification course are the kind of Roma who are taking the affairs of their community into their own hands and by doing so possibly helping Czech society to become more tolerant.</s> <s>The greatest difficulties for the Roma in the course were in Czech language.</s></p>
<p><s>The heads of the regional administrations acknowledged that Romani assitants are sorely needed in their offices and the Roma hope that they will be able to aid other Roma from their positions.</s> <s>The Roma don't expect easy work, however.</s> <s>"They will find themselves between two millstones - Roma and officials.</s> <s>There is some terrifically difficult work ahead of them," warned Pavel Pekarek, who deals with Romani problems.</s></p>
<C Mlynar's visit>
<p><s>Minister Vladimir Mlynar paid a visit on February 5 to another elementary school attended mostly by Romani children.</s> <s>After his visit to the Premysl Pitter school in Ostrava, he chose as his second school to visit a elementary school in the Predlice section of Usti nad Labem in northern Bohemia.</s> <s>He greeted the director of the school, Oldrich Batatk, with the words: "Being a Rom in this country is difficult, but being a minister here is also no fun!"</s> <s>The school's pupils take part in a number of cultural events - they sang, for example, to great acclaim at the Ghetto Museum in Terezin (Theresienstadt).</s> <s>Many of them also continue on to study in preparatory or technical schools (one graduate is studying at the pedagogical secondary school and another is studying at the veterinary sec.</s> <s>school), which for Romani children, considering the obstacles they encounter in their schooling, is very successful.</s></p>
<C "E luma romane jakhenca">
<p><s>In Lobkowitz Palace at Prague Castle on February 5, an exhibit of works by non-professional Romani artists visual artists entitled "E luma romane jakhenca - Svet ocima Romu" (The World through the Eyes of the Roma) was ceremoniously opened.</s> <s>The exhibition, which was put together by the Museum of Romani Culture in Brno in cooperation with Prague's National Museum, featured wooden sculptures, drawings and paintings by thirteen artists.</s> <s>The Romani artists mostly displayed in their works traditional Roma values, such as love for children and family, reverance for ancestors and the elderly, and in addition to this they turned back to the suffering of the Roma during the Second World War.</s> <s>All of the displayed works were created by men, since, said the exhibition's author, historian Jana Horvathova, they have much more time than Romani women.</s></p>
<C Charity drive>
<p><s>As of February 9, the Fund of North Moravian Journalists, established to receive contributions to help the Kovac family from Krnov, raised 22,000 crowns.</s> <s>The money will be used by the family to buy furniture, a washing machine, and other household furnishings.</s> <s>The fund received contributions from all over the country, as well as from the Jewish Museum in Prague.</s></p>
<C Another bomb>
<p><s>Another fire bomb ignited an apartment inhabited by Roma in Orlov na Karvinsku on February 13.</s> <s>The classic molotov cocktail, probably filled with gasoline, hit the floor in the kitchen, where it ignited the curtains and the carpet.</s> <s>The fire was put out by the residents themselves and fortunately nobody was injured.</s> <s>The police began an investigation of the crime as a breach of public order and damage to property.</s> <s>After classifying the investigation, the police ruled out a racial motive.</s> <s>The probable reason for the arson attack appeared to the police that someone wanted to settle some personal matters with the Romani family.</s></p>
<C Savage Attack in Vrchlabi>
<p><s>A 26-year-old Roma woman was attacked and savagely beaten, kicked and thrown unconscious into the Elbe River by three young skinheads.</s> <s>The attacked woman probably regained consciousness in the cold water and called for help.</s> <s>Her cries were heard by 48-year-old passer-by Eliska Pilarova.</s> <s>"I was coming back from my girlfriend's and I heard a cry for help.</s> <s>I ran towards the river, from where two men were just leaving.</s> <s>From the wall I then spotted a woman in the water calling to me that she couldn't swim," said Pilarova, describing the night's tragic events.</s> <s>She rushed to help the drowning woman and although she was seized in the strong current of freezing water, she was able to grab hold of the other woman.</s> <s>"It was clear that she was at the end of her strength, but she still managed to tell me 'they threw me in'," said Pilarova, who's considered a capable swimmer.</s> <s>But she couldn't have reckoned on the Elbe's current being strengthened by water released after a thaw in the Krkonose mountains from the dam at Spindler's Mill.</s> <s>The current swept both women toward the sluice-gate, into which they were carried and separated.</s> <s>"After that I don't remember anything.</s> <s>Evidently I swam to the middle of the river towards the rocks, where I hung on and called for help."</s> <s>From there she was helped by someone who happened to be passing by, who called emergency rescue.</s> <s>Doctors at the Vrchlabi hospital, where she was taken immediately, stated that aside from the shock from the below-freezing water she also sustained numerous bruises and a cracked vertabra.</s></p>
<p><s>Firefighters and police searched the river bed as well as the shore until four in the morning for the young Romani woman.</s> <s>They didn't find her body until Monday (Feb.16) morning, when the dam lowered the flow of water on the Elbe.</s> <s>Thanks to the testimony of Eliska Pilarova, police very quickly found the trio of youths who threw the woman into the river.</s> <s>"I saw them standing over the water and watching.</s> <s>Only then did they calmly walk away, and it's quite possible they were even amused over their deed," said Pilarova, and added: "If it were a matter of a certain type of sick people, then I would understand it.</s> <s>But the terrible thing is that they are convinced they did a good thing."</s></p>
<p><s>The police charged the three attackers with the crime of bodily harm in complicity committed with a racial subtext and put them in custody.</s> <s>Minister Vladimir Mlynar sharply condemned the attack, saying:"I only hope that it will be redefined as attempted murder."</s> <s>Redefinition as murder depends, according to Eastern Bohemia police spokesman Karel Matula, on the determination of the subjective side of the matter - whether the perpetrator intended to kill the person and whether all the facts indicate this.</s></p>
<p><s>In the case of a conviction for racially-motivated murder, the accused would face an especially long prison term.</s> <s>The head of the Eastern Bohemia regional department of investigation, Milos Kriz, said that the police will try to bring the case to trial "before the middle of the year."</s> <s>"We will do everything so that the case is finished on time and the perpetrators deservedly punished," he added.</s></p>
<p><s>The murdered Helena Bihariova was the mother of four, the youngest being just 8 months old.</s> <s>She came from Opava and had lived in Vrchlabi for 8 years with her partner Karel Lakatos.</s> <s>Her parents learned of the death of their daughter from the television news.</s> <s>Her father, Jan Bihari, said his daughter had a "bad life" in Vrchlabi, as she'd been verbally as well as physically attacked many times.</s> <s>Helena Bihariova's family immediately saw to the transfer of her remains to Opava and Jan Bihari stated that they also wanted to raise their grandchildren in Opava.</s> <s>Karel Lakatos, however, didn't want to give up his children at all.</s></p>

<p><s>The first threat to our national life was from the war.</s> <s>Then came other evil days and events that endangered the nation's spiritual well being and character.</s> <s>Most of the nation welcomed the socialist program with high hopes.</s> <s>But it fell into the hands of the wrong people.</s> <s>It would not have mattered so much that they lacked adequate experience in affairs of state, factual knowledge, or philosophical education, if only they bad enough common prudence and decency to listen to the opinion of others and agree to being gradually replaced by more able people.</s></p>
<p><s>After enjoying great popular confidence immediately after the war, the communist party by degrees bartered this confidence away for office, until it bad all the offices and nothing else.</s> <s>We feel we must say this, it is familiar to those of us who are communists and who are as disappointed as the rest at the way things turned out.</s> <s>The leaders' mistaken policies transformed a political party and an alliance based on ideas into an organization for exerting power, one that proved highly attractive to power-hungry individuals eager to wield authority, to cowards who took the safe and easy route, and to people with bad conscience.</s> <s>The influx of members such as these affected the character and behavior of the party, whose internal arrangements made it impossible, short of scandalous incidents, for honest members to gain influence and adapt it continuously to modern conditions.</s> <s>Many communists fought against this decline, but they did not manage to prevent what ensured.</s></p>
<p><s>Conditions inside the communist party served as both a pattern for and a cause of the identical conditions in the state.</s> <s>The party's association with the state deprived it of the asset of separation from executive power.</s> <s>No one criticized the activities of the state and of economic organs.</s> <s>Parliament forgot how to hold proper debates, the government forgot how to govern properly, and managers forgot how to manage properly.</s> <s>Elections lost their significance, and the law carried no weight.</s> <s>We could not trust our representatives on any committee or, if we could, there was no point in asking them for anything because they were powerless.</s> <s>Worse still, we could scarcely trust one another.</s> <s>Personal and collective honor decayed.</s> <s>Honesty was a useless virtue, assessment by merit unheard of.</s> <s>Most people accordingly lost interest in public affairs, worrying only about themselves and about money, a further blot on the system being the impossibility today of relying even on the value of money.</s> <s>Personal relations were ruined, there was no more joy in work, and the nation, in short, entered a period that endangered its spiritual well being and its character.</s></p>
<p><s>We all bear responsibility for the present state of affairs.</s> <s>But those among us who are communist's bear more than others, and those who acted as components or instruments of unchecked power bear the greatest responsibility of all.</s> <s>The power they wielded was that of a self-willed group spreading out through the party apparatus into every district and community.</s> <s>It was this apparatus that decided what might and might not be done: It ran the cooperative farms for the cooperative farmers, the factories for the workers, and the National Committees for the public.</s> <s>No organizations, not even communist ones, were really controlled by their own members.</s> <s>The chief sin and deception of these rulers was to have explained their own whims as the "will of the workers".</s> <s>Were we to accept this pretense, we would have to blame the workers today for the decline of our economy, for crimes committed against the innocent, and for the introduction of censorship to prevent anyone writing about these things.</s> <s>The workers would be to blame for misconceived investments, for losses suffered in foreign trade, and for the housing shortage.</s> <s>Obviously no sensible person will hold the working class responsible for such things.</s> <s>We all know, and every worker knows especially, that they had virtually no say in deciding anything.</s> <s>Working-class functionaries were given their voting instructions by somebody else.</s> <s>While many workers imagined that they were the rulers, it was a specially trained stratum of party and state officials who actually ruled in their name.</s> <s>In effect it was these people who stepped into the shoes of the deposed ruling class and themselves came to constitute the new authority.</s> <s>Let us say in fairness that some of them long ago realized the evil trick history had played.</s> <s>We can recognize such individuals today by the way they are redressing old wrongs, rectifying mistakes, handing back powers of decision-making to rank-and-file party members and members of the public, and establishing limits on the authority and size of the bureaucracy.</s> <s>They share our opposition to the retrograde views held by certain party members.</s> <s>But a large proportion of officials have been resistance to change and are still influential.</s> <s>They still wield the instruments of power, especially at district and community level, where they can employ them in secret and without fear of prosecution.</s></p>
<p><s>Since the beginning of this year we have been experiencing a regenerative process of democratization.</s> <s>It started inside the communist party, that much we must admit, even those communists among us who no longer had hopes that anything good could emerge from that quarter know this.</s> <s>It must also be added, of course, that the process could have started nowhere else.</s> <s>For after twenty years the communists were the only ones able to conduct some sort of political activity.</s> <s>It was only the opposition inside the communist party that had the privilege to voice antagonistic views.</s> <s>The effort and initiative now displayed by democratically minded communists are only then a partial repayment of the debt owed by the entire party to the non-communists whom it had kept down in an unequal position.</s> <s>Accordingly, thanks are due to the communist party, though perhaps it should be granted that the party is making an honest effort at the eleventh hour to save its own honor and the nation's.</s> <s>'me regenerative process has introduced nothing particularly new into our lives.</s> <s>It revives ideas and topics, many of which are older than the errors of our socialism, while others, having emerged from below the surface of visible history, should long ago have found expression but were instead repressed.</s> <s>Let us not foster the illusion that it is the power of truth which now makes such ideas victorious.</s> <s>Their victory has been due rather to the weakness of the old leaders, evidently already debilitated by twenty years of unchallenged rule.</s> <s>All the defects hidden in the foundations and ideology of the system have clearly reached their peak.</s> <s>So let us not overestimate the effects of the writers' and students' criticisms.</s> <s>The source of social change is the economy.</s> <s>A true word makes its mark only when it is spoken under conditions that have been properly prepared---conditions that, in our context, unfortunately include the impoverishment of our whole society and the complete collapse of the old system of government, which had enabled certain types of politicians to get rich, calmly and quietly, at our expense.</s> <s>Truth, then, is not prevailing.</s> <s>Truth is merely what remains when everything else has been frittered away.</s> <s>So there is no reason for national jubilation, simply for fresh hope.</s></p>
<p><s>In this moment of hope, albeit hope still threatened, we appeal to you.</s> <s>It took several months before many of us believed it was safe to speak up; many of us still do not think it is safe.</s> <s>But speak up we did exposing ourselves to the extent that we have no choice but to complete our plan to humanize the regime.</s> <s>If we did not, the old forces would exact cruel revenge.</s> <s>We appeal above all to those who so far have waited on the sidelines.</s> <s>The time now approaching will decide events for years to come.</s></p>
<p><s>The summer holidays are approaching, a time when we are inclined to let everything slip.</s> <s>But we can safely say that our dear adversaries will not give themselves a summer break; they will rally everyone who is under any obligation to them and are taking steps, even now, to secure themselves a quiet Christmas!</s> <s>Let us watch carefully how things develop, let us try to understand them and have our answers ready.</s> <s>Let us forget the impossible demand that someone from on high should always provide us with a single explanation and a single, simple moral imperative.</s> <s>Everyone will have to draw their own conclusions.</s> <s>Common, agreed conclusions can only be reached in discussion that requires freedom of speech-the only democratic achievement to our credit this year.</s></p>
<p><s>But in the days to come we must gird ourselves with our own initiative and make our own decisions.</s></p>
<p><s>To begin with we will oppose the view, sometimes voiced, that a democratic revival can be achieved without the communists, or even in opposition to them.</s> <s>This would be unjust, and foolish too.</s> <s>The communists already have their organizations in place, and in these we must support the progressive wing.</s> <s>They have their experienced officials, and they still have in their hands, after all, the crucial levers and buttons.</s> <s>On the other hand they have presented an Action Program to the public.</s> <s>This program will begin to even out the most glaring inequalities, and no one else has a program in such specific detail.</s> <s>We must demand that they produce local Action Programs in public in every district and community.</s> <s>7hen the issue will suddenly revolve around very ordinary and long awaited acts of justice.</s> <s>The Czechoslovak Communist Party is preparing for its congress, where it will elect its new Central Committee.</s> <s>Let us demand that it be a better committee than the present one.</s> <s>Today the communist party says it is going to rest its position of leadership on the confidence of the public, and not on force.</s> <s>Let us believe them, but only as long as we can believe in the people they are now sending as delegates to the party's district and regional conferences.</s></p>
<p><s>People have recently been worried that the democratization process has come to a halt.</s> <s>This feeling is partly a sign of fatigue after the excitement of events, but partly it reflects the truth.</s> <s>The season of astonishing revelations, of dismissals from high office, and of heady speeches couched in language of unaccustomed daring-all this is over.</s> <s>But the struggle between opposing forces has merely become somewhat less open, the fight continues over the content and formulation of the laws and over the scope of practical measures.</s> <s>Besides, we must give the new people time to work: the new ministers, prosecutors, chairmen and secretaries.</s> <s>They are entitled to time in which to prove themselves fit or unfit.</s> <s>This is all that can be expected at present of the central political bodies, though they have made a remarkably good showing so far in spite of themselves.</s></p>
<p><s>The everyday quality of our future democracy depends on what happens in the factories, and on what happens to the factories.</s> <s>Despite all our discussions, it is the economic managers who have us in their grasp.</s> <s>Good managers must be sought out and promoted.</s> <s>True, we are all badly paid in comparison with people in the developed countries, some of us worse than others.</s> <s>We can ask for more money, and more money can indeed be printed, but only if it is devalued in the process.</s> <s>Let us rather ask the directors and the chairmen of boards to tell us what they want to produce and at what cost, the customers they want to sell it to and at what price, the profit that will be made, and of that, how much will be reinvested in modernizing production and how much will be left over for distribution.</s> <s>Under dreary looking headlines, a bard battle is being covered in the press-the battle of democracy versus soft jobs.</s> <s>The workers, as entrepreneurs, can intervene in this battle by electing the right people to management and workers' councils.</s> <s>And as employees they can help themselves best by electing, as their trade union representatives, natural leaders and able, honorable individuals without regard to party affiliation.</s></p>
<p><s>Although at present one cannot expect more of the central political bodies, it is vital to achieve more at district and community level.</s> <s>Let us demand the departure of people who abused their power, damaged public property, and acted dishonorably or brutally.</s> <s>Ways must be found to compel them to resign.</s> <s>To mention a few: public criticism, resolutions, demonstrations, demonstrative work brigades, collections to buy presents for them on their retirement, strikes, and picketing at their front doors.</s> <s>But we should reject any illegal, indecent, or boorish methods, which they would exploit to bring influence to bear on Alexander Dubcek.</s> <s>Our aversion to the writing of rude letters must be expressed so completely that the only explanation for any such missives in the future would be that their recipients had ordered them themselves.</s> <s>Let us revive the activity of the National Front.</s> <s>Let us demand public sessions of the national committees.</s> <s>For questions that no one else will look into, let us set up our own civic committees and commissions.</s> <s>There is nothing difficult about it; a few people gather together, elect a chairman, keep proper records, publish their findings, demand solutions, and refuse to be shouted down.</s> <s>Let us convert the district and local newspapers, which have mostly degenerated to the lever of official mouthpieces, into a platform for all the forward-looking elements in politics; let us demand that editorial boards be formed of National Front representatives, or else let us start new papers.</s> <s>Let us form committees for the defense of free speech.</s> <s>At our meetings, let us have our own staffs for ensuring order.</s> <s>If we hear strange reports, let us seek confirmation, let us send delegations to the proper authorities and publicize their answers, perhaps putting them up on front gates.</s> <s>Let us give support to the police when they are prosecuting genuine wrongdoers, for it is not our aim to create anarchy or a state of general uncertainty.</s> <s>Let us eschew quarrels between neighbors, and let us avoid drunkenness on political occasions.</s> <s>Let us expose informers.</s></p>
<p><s>The summer traffic throughout the republic will enhance interest in the settlement of constitutional relations between Czechs and Slovaks.</s> <s>Let us consider federalization as a method of solving the question of nationalities, hut let us regard it as only one of several important measures designed to democratize the system.</s> <s>In itself this particular measure will not necessarily give even the Slovaks a better life.</s> <s>Merely having separate governments in the Czech Lands and in Slovakia does not solve the problem of government.</s> <s>Rule by a state and party bureaucracy could still go on; indeed, in Slovakia it might even be strengthened by the claim that it had "won more freedom.</s></p>
<p><s>There has been great alarm recently over the possibility that foreign forces will intervene in our development.</s> <s>Whatever superior forces may face us, all we can do is stick to our own positions, behave decently, and initiate nothing ourselves.</s> <s>We can show our government that we will stand by it, with weapons if need be, if it will do what we give it a mandate to do.</s> <s>And we can assure our allies that we will observe our treaties of alliance, friendship, and trade.</s> <s>Irritable reproaches and iii-argued suspicions on our part can only make things harder for our government, and bring no benefit to ourselves.</s> <s>In any case, the only way we can achieve equality is to improve our domestic situation and carry the process of renewal far enough to some day elect statesman with sufficient courage, honor, and political acumen to create such equality and keep it that way.</s> <s>But this is a problem that faces all governments of small countries everywhere.</s></p>
<p><s>This spring a great opportunity was given to us once again, as it was after the end of the war.</s> <s>Again we have the chance to take into our own hands our common cause, which for working purposes we call socialism, and give it a form more appropriate to our once-good reputation and to the fairly good opinion we used to have of ourselves.</s> <s>The spring is over and will never return.</s> <s>By winter we will know all.</s></p>
<p><s>So ends our statement addressed to workers, farmers, officials, artists, scholars, scientists, technicians, and everybody.</s> <s>It was written at the behest of scholars and scientists.</s></p>
