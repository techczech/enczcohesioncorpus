<p><s>In February 1948, Communist leader Klement Gottwald stepped out on the balcony of a Baroque palace in Prague to address the hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens packed into Old Town Square.</s> <s>It was a crucial moment in Czech history—a fateful moment of the kind that occurs once or twice in a millennium.</s></p>
<p><s>Gottwald was flanked by his comrades, with Clementis standing next to him.</s> <s>There were snow flurries, it was cold, and Gottwald was bareheaded.</s> <s>The solicitous Clementis took off his own fur cap and set it on Gottwald's head. </s></p>
<p><s>The Party propaganda section put out hundreds of thousands of copies of a photograph of that balcony with Gottwald, a fur cap on his head and comrades at his side, speaking to the nation.</s> <s>On that balcony the history of Communist Czechoslovakia was born.</s> <s>Every child knew the photograph from posters, schoolbooks, and museums.</s></p>
<p><s>Four years later Clementis was charged with treason and hanged.</s> <s>The propaganda section immediately airbrushed him out of history and, obviously, out of all the photographs as well.</s> <s>Ever since, Gottwald has stood on that balcony alone.</s> <s>Where Clementis once stood, there is only bare palace wall.</s> <s>All that remains of Clementis is the cap on Gottwald's head.</s></p>
<p><s>It is 1971, and Mirek says that the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.</s></p>
<p><s>That is his attempt to justify what his friends call carelessness: keeping a careful diary, preserving all correspondence, taking notes at meetings where there is discussion of the current situation and debate of where to go from here.</s> <s>Nothing we do is in violation of the constitution, he tells them.</s> <s>Trying to hide, feeling guilty— that's the beginning of the end.</s></p>
<p><s>A week ago, while working with a crew on the roof of a new building, he looked down and had a sudden dizzy spell.</s> <s>He lost his balance and grabbed at a poorly fastened beam, but it came loose and he had to be pulled out from under it.</s> <s>At first the injury looked serious, but later, when he learned it was just a run-of-the-mill broken arm, he said to himself with satisfaction that now he'd get a week or two off and have time for some things he'd been meaning to take care of.</s></p>
<p><s>He had finally come around to the position of his more cautious friends.</s> <s>True, the constitution guaranteed freedom of speech; but the law punished any act that could be construed as undermining the state.</s> <s>Who could tell when the state would start screaming that this or that word was undermining it?</s> <s>He decided he'd better put the incriminating papers in a safe place after all.</s></p>
<p><s>First, though, he wanted to settle the Zdena problem.</s> <s>He called her long distance, but couldn't reach her.</s> <s>He wasted four whole days calling.</s> <s>Then yesterday he'd finally gotten through.</s> <s>She'd promised to wait for him this afternoon.</s></p>
<p><s>His seventeen-year-old son protested that he couldn't possibly drive with his arm in a cast.</s> <s>It really was pretty hard going.</s> <s>His injured arm swung helpless and useless in its sling on his chest.</s> <s>Whenever he changed gears, he had to let go of the steering wheel for a second.</s></p>
<p><s>Twenty-five years had gone by since his affair with Zdena, and all he had left of it was a few memories.</s></p>
<p><s>Once she showed up dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and blowing her nose.</s> <s>He asked her what the matter was.</s> <s>A Russian statesman had died the day before, she told him.</s> <s>Some Zhdanov, Arbuzov, or Masturbov.</s> <s>Judging by the number of teardrops, she was more disturbed by Masturbov's death than by the death of her own father.</s></p>
<p><s>Could that actually have happened?</s> <s>Or was her lament for Masturbov merely a figment of his present hatred?</s> <s>No, it had happened, though of course the immediate circumstances making the event credible and real escaped him now, and the memory had become implausible, a caricature.</s></p>
<T Saturnin>
<p><s>While I dislike all the comparisons and parables with which Doctor Vlach habitually lards his spirited discourse, I do recognise that his telling parable of the café, mankind and a bowl of doughnuts is not without merit.</s> <s>For it permits me to demonstrate, at least up to a point, what manner of man Saturnin is.</s></p>
<p><s>You have to appreciate that Doctor Vlach classifies people according to their behaviour in a half-deserted café when faced with a bowl of doughnuts.</s> <s>Imagine a high-class café on a Sunday morning.</s> <s>It’s a glorious sunny day and there are very few customers inside.</s> <s>You’ve taken breakfast, read all the newspapers and now you are lounging comfortably in a well-upholstered alcove, gazing thoughtfully at a bowl full of doughnuts.</s> <s>Tedium gradually filters into every corner of the café.</s></p>
<p><s>According to the Vlach theory, it is at this point that your affinity with this or that group of people emerges.</s> <s>If you are a person lacking in imagination, energy and a sense of humour, you will gaze at the doughnuts in mute passivity until noon, when you will rise and go for lunch.</s></p>
<p><s>I have reason to believe that, according to Doctor Vlach, this category includes myself.</s> <s>I also believe he is wrong.</s> <s>We need say nothing of humour or energy, but the fact that he denies me any imagination when he knows full well that I have succeeded in filling in my income tax and national insurance forms to perfection really does surprise one.</s> <s>But never mind.</s> <s>Even if I did belong to that group, I would find it more palatable than being a member of group two, which allegedly whiles the time away imagining what would happen if, out of the blue and without warning, someone started pelting the other customers with the doughnuts.</s></p>
<p><s>I fail to understand how an intelligent adult can think of such things.</s> <s>Yet I concur entirely with Doctor Vlach’s view of himself as one who does belong to the latter category.</s> <s>And for some unfathomable reason is proud of the fact!</s> <s>He views such people as intellectually more mature.</s> <s>For my own part, I am mystified as to what unites intellectual maturity and the image of doughnuts splattering on the heads of innocent coffee-drinkers.</s> <s>It’s beyond me, but so be it; let’s not argue about it.</s> <s>I have 0 an unshakeable view of debates with Doctor Vlach, for whenever I have entered upon one I have inevitably had the feeling of one who has been crazy enough to batter a hole in the retaining wall of a high dam using only his head.</s></p>
<p><s>Now, if Fate had not brought Saturnin my way, I might never have believed that there are also persons of a third category, rare though they be.</s> <s>By these I mean people who are so seduced by the image of doughnuts whizzing through the air that they get up and make the image a reality.</s></p>
<p><s>Doctor Vlach holds such individuals in the highest regard.</s> <s>It is his contention that such an act calls not only for a finely tuned sense of the comic, but also for courage, spirit and goodness knows what else.</s> <s>My own view is that it calls for such an extraordinary dose of folly that any sensible being must be seized with amazement that such people are also to be encountered outside the walls of those institutions which human society has erected for them.</s> <s>It has been my misfortune to have acquired first-hand experience of the existence of such people and to have learned that their personal liberty is in no wise constrained.</s> <s>For Saturnin is indeed one of them.</s></p>

<T Charta>
<p><s>In the Czechoslovak Collection of Laws, no.</s> <s>120 of 13 October 1976, texts were published of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which were signed on behalf of our Republic in 1968, were confirmed at Helsinki in 1975 and came into force in our country on 23 March 1976.</s> <s>From that date our citizens have the right, and our state the duty, to abide by them.</s> </p>
<p><s>The human rights and freedoms underwritten by these covenants constitute important assets of civilised life for which many progressive movements have striven throughout history and whose codification could greatly contribute to the development of a humane society.</s><s>We accordingly welcome the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic's accession to those agreements.</s> </p>
<p><s>Their publication, however, serves as an urgent reminder of the extent to which basic human rights in our country exist, regrettably, on paper only.</s></p>
<p><s>The right to freedom of expression, for example, guaranteed by article 19 of the first-mentioned covenant, is in our case purely illusory.</s> </p>
<p><s>Tens of thousands of our citizens are prevented from working in their own fields for the sole reason that they hold views differing from official ones, and are discriminated against and harassed in all kinds of ways by the authorities and public organisations.</s> <s>Deprived as they are of any means to defend themselves, they become victims of a virtual apartheid.</s> </p>
<p><s>Hundreds of thousands of other citizens are denied that 'freedom from fear' mentioned in the preamble to the first covenant, being condemned to live in constant danger of unemployment or other penalties if they voice their own opinions.</s> </p>
<p><s>In violation of article 13 of the second-mentioned covenant, guaranteeing everyone the right to education, countless young people are prevented from studying because of their own views or even their parents'.</s> <s>Innumerable citizens live in fear that their own or their children's right to education may be withdrawn if they should ever speak up in accordance with their convictions.</s> <s>Any exercise of the right to 'seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print' or 'in the form of art', specified in article 19, para.</s> <s>2 of the first covenant, is punished by extrajudicial or even judicial sanctions, often in the form of criminal charges as in the recent trial of young musicians.</s> </p>
<p><s>Freedom of public expression is repressed by the centralised control of all the communications media and of publishing and cultural institutions.</s> <s>No philosophical, political or scientific view or artistic expression that departs ever so slightly from the narrow bounds of official ideology or aesthetics is allowed to be published; no open criticism can be made of abnormal social phenomena; no public defence is possible against false and insulting charges made in official propaganda; the legal protection against 'attacks on honour and reputation' clearly guaranteed by article 17 of the first covenant is in practice non-existent; false accusations cannot be rebutted and any attempt to secure compensation or correction through the courts is futile; no open debate is allowed in the domain of thought and art.</s> <s>Many scholars, writers, artists and others are penalised for having legally published or expressed, years ago, opinions which are condemned by those who hold political power today.</s> </p>
<p><s>Freedom of religious confession, emphatically guaranteed by article 18 of the first covenant, is systematically curtailed by arbitrary official action; by interference with the activity of churchmen, who are constantly threatened by the refusal of the state to permit them the exercise of their functions, or by the withdrawal of such permission; by financial or other measures against those who express their religious faith in word or action; by constraints on religious training and so forth.</s> </p>
<T Penicilin>
<p><s>Recent years have seen widespread commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin along with the fortieth anniversary of its chemical isolation and the start of its manufacture as one of the most successful anti-microbial drugs ever.</s> <s>There may therefore seem to be little point in recalling the particular history of the drug in one small country, especially one whose significance had little impact on the wider world.</s> <s>The manufacture of and treatment with penicillin in Czechoslovakia is doubtless a minor episode in the context of the world history of its discovery, production and therapeutic application; on the other hand, it is such a unique episode and so different from how it was introduced in any other country that I believe a summary history of it is warranted.</s> <s>The more justly so given that those directly involved and other first-hand witnesses are slowly disappearing.</s> <s>Additionally, there are the specific features – no less interesting for the history of medicine – of the experimental work which, inspired by the discovery of penicillin and carried out in the difficult conditions of working underground under Nazi occupation, finally led to the preparation of a drug which, if not identical to penicillin, was analogous to it.</s> <s>This in turn added uniquely interesting features to the systematic introduction of treatment with the penicillin supplied after the war by UNRRA, and ultimately to the launch of industrial manufacture, likewise facilitated by supplies from the same post-war aid organisation.</s></p>
<p><s>By way of introduction to this section, it is doubtless proper to recall that the work did have a particular domestic tradition behind it: First, there is the systematic use of microbial products of pyocyanea bacillus in medical practice.</s> <s>As early as 1898, Professor I.</s> <s>Honl published with Bukovský the undoubtedly successful results arising from the treatment of festering leg ulcers; these results even led to the production of tablets that were recommended for the local treatment of anginas, especially streptococcal.</s> <s>Nor did Fleming’s 1929 discovery of penicillin pass without an echo: on water cultures sent in for purity testing, F.</s> <s>Patoèka succeeded in capturing an antibiotic coccoid organism which he called Polycoccus honli, having failed to classify it systematically among the known coccoid organisms.</s> <s>While still a medical student, I was invited by Patoèka to join in the experimental work with this organism, which produced antibiotic agents effective against the grampositive microbes – especially streptococci and Bac.</s> <s>anthracis – that were used for the titration of its effect.</s> <s>By then (1930) it had become possible to isolate the agent and determine its chemistry; all I recall is that I achieved a roughly tenfold concentration of the agent from the filtrate by adsorption onto aluminium oxide and active charcoal.</s></p>
<p><s>The opportunities for work on isolation were quite different by the time we learned (during the Occupation, when all contacts with scientists in the West were sundered), from the last literature to arrive and from radio reports, of the successful isolation of penicillin and its miraculous effects.</s></p>

The world has been very kind to this book.</s> <s>The sales of the English editions in their various forms have exceeded a million and a half.</s> <s>In Chicago I was assured many years ago, by an enterprising pirate now retired, that the sales throughout the United States had exceeded a million; and although, in consequence of its having been published before the Copyright Convention, this has brought me no material advantage, the fame and popularity it has won for me among the American public is an asset not to be despised.</s> <s>It has been translated into, I think, every European language, also into some of those of Asia.</s> <s>It has brought me many thousands of letters from young folk, from old folk; from well folk, from sick folk; from merry folk, from sad folk.</s> <s>They have come to me from all parts of the world, from men and women of all countries.</s> <s>Had these letters been the only result I should feel glad that I had written the book.</s> <s>I retain a few blackened pages of one copy sent me by a young colonial officer from South Africa.</s> <s>They were taken from the knapsack of a dead comrade found on Spion Kop.</s> <s>So much for testimonials.</s> </p>
<p><s>It remains only to explain the merits justifying such an extraordinary success.</s> <s>I am quite unable to do so.</s> <s>I have written books that have appeared to me more clever, books that have appeared to me more humorous.</s> <s>But it is as the author of Three Men in a Boat (to say nothing of the Dog) that the public persists in remembering me.</s> <s>Certain critics used to suggest that it was the vulgarity of the book, its entire absence of humour, that accounted for its success with the people; but one feels by this time that such a suggestion does not solve the riddle.</s> <s>Bad art may succeed for a time and with a limited public; it does not go on extending its circle throughout nearly half a century.</s> </p>
<p><s>I have come to the conclusion that, be the explanation what it may, I can take credit to myself for having written this book.</s> <s>That is, if I did write it.</s> <s>For really I hardly remember doing so.</s> <s>I remember only feeling very young and absurdly pleased with myself for reasons that concern only myself.</s> <s>It was summer time, and London is so beautiful in summer.</s> <s>It lay beneath my window a fairy city veiled in golden mist, for I worked in a room high up above the chimney- pots; and at night the lights shone far beneath me.</s> <s>so that I looked down as into an Aladdin's cave of jewels.</s> <s>It was during those summer months I wrote this book; it seemed the only thing to do.</s> </p>

Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course.</s> <s>Human activities inflict harsh and often irreversible damage on the environment and on critical resources.</s> <s>If not checked, many of our current practices put at serious risk the future that we wish for human society and the plant and animal kingdoms, and may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know 0.</s> <s>Fundamental changes are urgent if we are to avoid the collision our present course will bring about.</s></p>
<p><s>Stratospheric ozone depletion threatens us with enhanced ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, which can be damaging or lethal to many life forms.</s> <s>Air pollution near ground level, and acid precipitation, are already causing widespread injury to humans, forests, and crops.</s></p>
<p><s>Heedless exploitation of depletable ground water supplies endangers food production and other essential human systems.</s> <s>Heavy demands on the world's surface waters have resulted in serious shortages in some 80 countries, containing 40 percent of the world's population.</s> <s>Pollution of rivers, lakes, and ground water further limits the supply.</s></p>
<p><s>Destructive pressure on the oceans is severe, particularly in the coastal regions which produce most of the world's food fish.</s> <s>The total marine catch is now at or above the estimated maximum sustainable yield.</s> <s>Some fisheries have already shown signs of collapse.</s> <s>Rivers carrying heavy burdens of eroded soil into the seas also carry industrial, municipal, agricultural, and livestock waste -- some of it toxic.</s></p>
<p><s>Loss of soil productivity, which is causing extensive land abandonment, is a widespread by-product of current practices in agriculture and animal husbandry.</s> <s>Since 1945, 11 percent of the earth's vegetated surface has been degraded -- an area larger than India and China combined -- and per capita food production in many parts of the world is decreasing.</s></p>

<p><s>The irreversible loss of species, which by 2100 may reach one-third of all species now living, is especially serious.</s> <s>We are losing the potential they hold for providing medicinal and other benefits, and the contribution that genetic diversity of life forms gives to the robustness of the world's biological systems and to the astonishing beauty of the earth itself.</s> <s>Much of this damage is irreversible on a scale of centuries, or permanent.</s> <s>Other processes appear to pose additional threats.</s> <s>Increasing levels of gases in the atmosphere from human activities, including carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel burning and from deforestation, may alter climate on a global scale.</s> <s>Predictions of global warming are still uncertain -- with projected effects ranging from tolerable to very severe -- but the potential risks are very great.</s></p>
