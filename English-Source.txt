<p><s>A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead.</s> <s>I say 'one chooses ' with the inaccurate pride of a professional writer who—when he has been seriously noted at all—has been praised for his technical ability, but do I in fact of my own will choose that black wet January night on the Common, in 1946, the sight of Henry Miles slanting across the wide river of rain, or did these images choose me?</s> <s>It is convenient, it is correct according to the rules of my craft to begin just there, but if I had believed then in a God, I could also have believed in a hand, plucking at my elbow, a suggestion, "Speak to him: he hasn't seen you yet."</s></p>
<p><s>For why should I have spoken'to him?</s> <s>If hate is not too large a term to use in relation to any human being, I hated Henry—I hated his wife Sarah too.</s> <s>And he, I suppose, came soon after the events of that evening to Hate me: as he surely at times must have hated his wife and that other, in whom in those days we were lucky enough not to believe.</s> <s>So this is a record of hate far more than of love, and if I come to say anything in favour of Henry and Sarah I can be trusted: I am writing against the bias because it is my professional pride to prefer the near-truth, even to the expression of my near-hate.</s> <s>It was strange to see Henry out on such a night: he liked his comfort and after all—or so I thought—he had Sarah.</s> <s>To me comfort is like the wrong memory at the wrong place or time: if one is lonely one prefers discomfort.</s> <s>There was too much comfort even in the bed-sitting-room I had at the wrong—the south—side of the Common, in the relics of other people's furniture.</s> <s>I thought I would go for a walk through the rain and have a drink at the local.</s> <s>The little crowded hall wa?</s> <s>full of strangers' hats and coats and I took somebody else's umbrella by accident—the man on the second floor had friends in.</s> <s>Then I closed the stained-glass door behind me and made my way carefully down the steps that had been blasted in 1944 and never repaired.</s> <s>I had reason to remember the occasion and how the stained glass, tough and ugly and Victorian, stood up to the shock as our grandfathers themselves would have done.</s></p>
<p><s>Directly I began to cross the Common I realised I had the wrong umbrella, for it sprang a leak and the rain ran down under my macintosh collar, and then it was I saw Henry.</s> <s>I could so easily have avoided him; he had no umbrella and in the light of the lamp I could see his eyes were blinded with the rain.</s> <s>The black leafless trees, gave no protection: they stood around like broken water-pipes; and the rain dripped off his stiff dark hat and ran in streams down his black civil servant's overcoat.</s> <s>If I had walked straight by him, he wouldn't have seen me, and I could have made certain by stepping two feet off the pavement, but I said, "Henry, you are almost a stranger," and saw his eyes light up as though we were old friends.</s></p>
<p><s>"Bendrix," he said with affection, and yet the world would have said he had the reasons for hate, not me.</s></p>
<p><s>"What are you up to, Henry, in the rain?"</s> <s>There are men whom one has an irresistible desire to tease: men whose virtues one doesn't share.</s> <s>He said evasively, "Oh, I wanted a bit of air," and during a sudden blast of wind and rain he just caught his hat in time from being whirled away towards the north side.</s></p>
<p><s>"How's Sarah?"</s> <s>I asked because it might have seemed odd if I hadn't, though nothing would have delighted me more than to have heard that she was sick, unhappy, dying.</s> <s>I imagined in those days that any suffering she underwent would lighten mine, and if she were dead I could be free: I would no longer imagine all the things one does imagine under my ignoble circumstances.</s> <s>I could even like poor silly Henry, I thought, if Sarah were dead.</s></p>
<p><s>He said, "Oh, she's out for the evening somewhere," and set that devil in my mind at work again, remembering other days when Henry must have replied just like that to other inquirers, while I alone knew where Sarah was.</s> <s>"A drink?"</s> <s>I asked, and to my surprise he put himself in step beside me.</s> <s>We had never before drunk together outside his home.</s></p>
<p><s>"It's a long time since we've seen you, Bendrix."</s> <s>For some reason I am a man known by his surname—I might never have been christened for all the use my friends make of the rather affected Maurice my literary parents gave me.</s></p>
<p><s>"A long time."</s></p>
<p><s>"Why, it must be—more than a year."</s></p>
<p><s>"June 1944," I said.</s></p>
<p><s>"As long as that—well, well."</s> <s>The fool, I thought, the fool to see nothing strange in a year and a half's interval.</s> <s>Less than five hundred yards of flat grass separated our two "sides".</s> <s>Had it never occurred to him to say to Sarah, "How's Bendrix doing?</s> <s>What about asking Bendrix in?"</s> <s>and hadn't her replies ever seemed to him • .</s> <s>.</s> <s>odd, evasive, suspicious?</s> <s>I had fallen out of their sight as completely as a stone in a pond.</s> <s>I suppose the ripples may have disturbed Sarah for a week, a month .</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>but Henry's blinkers were so firmly tied.</s> <s>I had hated his blinkers even when I had benefited from them, knowing that others could benefit too.</s></p>
<p><s>"Is she at the cinema?"</s> <s>I asked.</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh no, she hardly ever goes."</s></p>
<p><s>"She used to."</s></p>
<p><s>The "Pontefract Arms" was still decorated for Christmas with paper streamers and paper bells, the relics on commercial gaiety, mauve and orange, and the young landlady leant her breasts against the bar with a look of contempt for her customers.</s></p>
<p><s>"Pretty," Henry said, without meaning it, and stared around with a certain lost air, a shyness, for somewhere to hang his hat.</s> <s>I got the impression that the nearest he had ever before been to a public bar was the chop house off Northumberland Avenue where he ate lunch with his colleagues from the Ministry.</s> <s>"What will you have?"</s> <s>"I wouldn't mind a whisky."</s></p>
<p><s>"Nor would I, but you'll have to make do with rum."</s></p>
<p><s>We sat at a table and fingered our glasses: I had never had much to say to Henry.</s> <s>I doubt whether I should ever have troubled to know Henry or Sarah well if I had not begun in 1939 to write a story with a senior civil servant as the main character.</s> <s>Henry James once, in a discussion with Walter Besant, said that a young woman with sufficient talent need only pass the mess-room windows of a Guards' barracks and look inside in order to write a novel about the Brigade, but I think at some stage of her book she would have found it necessary to go to bed with a Guardsman if only in order to check on the details.</s> <s>I didn't exactly go to bed with Henry, but I did the next best thing, and the first night I took Sarah out to dinner I had the cold-blooded intention of picking the brain of a civil servant's wife.</s> <s>She didn't know what I was at; she thought, I am sure, I was genuinely interested in her family life, and perhaps that first awakened her liking for me.</s> <s>What time did Henry have breakfast?</s> <s>I asked her.</s> <s>Did he go to the office by tube, bus or taxi?</s> <s>Did he bring his work home at night?</s> <s>Did he have a brief-case with the royal arms on it?</s> <s>Our friendship blossomed under my interest: she was so pleased that anybody should take Henry seriously.</s> <s>Henry was important, but important rather as an elephant is important, from the size of his department; there are some kinds of importance that remain hopelessly damned to unseriousness.</s> <s>Henry was an important assistant secretary in the Ministry of Pensions—later it was to be the Ministry of Home Security.</s> <s>Home Security—I used to laugh at that later in those moments when you hate Your companion and look for any weapon ...</s> <s>A time came when I deliberately told Sarah that I had only taken Henry up for the purpose of copy, copy too for a character who was the ridiculous, the comic element in my book.</s> <s>It was then she began to dislike my novel.</s> <s>She had an enormous loyalty to Henry (I could never deny that), and in those clouded hours when the demon took charge of my brain and I resented even harmless Henry, I would use the novel and invent episodes too crude to write.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>Once when Sarah had spent a whole night with me (I had looked forward to it as a writer looks forward to the last word of his book) I had spoilt the occasion suddenly by a chance word which broke the mood of what sometimes seemed for hours at a time a complete love.</s> <s>I had fallen sullenly asleep about two and woke at three, and putting my hand on her arm woke Sarah.</s> <s>I think I had meant to make everything well again, until my victim turned her face, bleary and beautiful with sleep and full of trust towards me.</s> <s>She had forgotten the quarrel, and I found even in her forgetfulness a new cause.</s> <s>How twisted we humans are, and yet they say a God made us; but I find it hard to conceive of any God who is not as simple as perfect equation, as clear as air.</s> <s>I said to her, "I've lair awake thinking of Chapter Five.</s> <s>Does Henry ever eat coffee beans to clear his breath before an important conference?"</s> <s>She shook her head and began to cry silently, and I of course pretended not to understand the reason—a simple question, it had been worrying me about my character, this was not an attack on Henry, the nicest people sometimes eat coffee beans.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>.</s> <s>So I went on She wept awhile and went to sleep—she was a good sleeper, and I took even her power to sleep as an added offence.</s></p>
<p><s>Henry drank his rum quickly, his gaze wandering miserably among the mauve and orange streamers, I asked, "Had a good Christmas?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Very nice.</s> <s> Very nice," he said.</s></p>
<p><s>"At home?"</s> <s>Henry looked up at me as though my inflection of the word sounded strange.</s></p>
<p><s>"Home?</s> <s> Yes, of course."</s></p>
<p><s>"And Sarah's well?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"Have another rum?"</s></p>
<p><s>"It's my turn."</s> <s>While Henry fetched the drinks I went into the lavatory.</s> <s>The walls were scrawled with phrases: "Damn you, landlord, and your breasty wife."</s> <s>"To all pimps and whores a merry syphilis and a happy gonorrhea."</s> <s>I went quickly out again to the cheery paper streamers and the clink of glass.</s> <s>Sometimes I see myself reflected too closely in other men for comfort, and then I have an enormous wish to believe in the saints, in heroic virtue.</s></p>
<p><s>I repeated to Henry the two lines I had seen.</s> <s>I wanted to shock him, and it surprised me when he said simply, "Jealousy's an awful thing."</s> <s>"You mean the bit about the breasty wife?"</s> <s>"Both of them.</s> <s>When you are miserable, you envy other people's happiness."</s></p>
<p><s>It wasn't what I had ever expected him to learn in the Ministry of Home Security.</s> <s>And there—in that phrase—the bitterness leaks again out of my pen.</s> <s>What a dull lifeless quality this bitterness is.</s> <s>" I could I would write with love, but if I could write with love, I would be another man: I would never have lost love.</s> <s>Yet suddenly across the shiny tiled surface of the bar-table I felt something, nothing so extreme as love perhaps  nothing  more than a  companionship  in misfortune.</s> <s> I said to Henry, "Are you miserable?"</s> <s>"Bendrix, I'm worried."</s> <s>"Tell me."</s></p>
<p><s>I expect it was the rum that made him speak, or was he partly aware of how much I knew about him?</s> <s>Sarah was loyal, but in a relationship such as ours had been you can't help picking up a thing or two.</s> <s>...</s> <s>I knew he had a mole on the left of his navel because a birthmark of my own had once reminded Sarah of it: I knew he suffered from short sight, but wouldn't wear glasses with strangers (and I was still enough of a stranger never to have seen him in them): I knew his liking for tea at ten: I even knew his sleeping habits.</s> <s>Was he conscious that I knew so much already, that one more fact would not aha our relation?</s> <s>He said.</s> <s>"I'm worried about Sarah, Bendrix."</s></p>
<p><s>The door of the bar opened and I could see the rain lashing down against the light.</s> <s>A little hilarious man darted in and called out, "Wot cher, everybody," and nobody answered.</s></p>
<p><s>"Is she ill?</s> <s> I thought you said ..."</s></p>
<p><s>"No.</s> <s>Not ill.</s> <s>I don't think so."</s> <s>He looked miserably around—this was not his milieu.</s> <s>I noticed that the whites of his eyes were bloodshot; perhaps he hadn't bed wearing his glasses enough—there are always so many strangers, or it might have been the after-effect of tears.</s> <s>He said, "Bendrix, I can't talk here," as though he had once been in the habit of talking somewhere.</s> <s>"Come home with me."</s></p>
<p><s>"Will Sarah be back?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I don't expect so."</s></p>
<p><s>I paid for the drinks, and that again was a sympton of Henry's disturbance—he never took other people's hospitality easily.</s> <s>He was always the one in a taxi to have the money ready in the palm of his hand, while we others fumbled.</s> <s>The avenues of the Common still ran with rain, but it wasn't far to Henry's.</s> <s>He let himself in with a latch-key under the Queen Anne fanlight and called, "Sarah.</s> <s>Sarah."</s> <s>I longed for a reply and dreaded a reply, but nobody answered.</s> <s>He said, "She's out still.</s> <s>Come into the study."</s></p>
<p><s>I had never been in his study before: I had always been Sarah's friend, and when I met Henry it was on Sarah's territory, her haphazard living-room where nothing matched, nothing was period or planned, where every' thing seemed to belong to that very week because nothing was ever allowed to remain as a token of past taste or past sentiment.</s> <s>Everything was used there; just as in Henry's study I now felt that very little had ever been used.</s> <s>I doubted whether the set of Gibbon had once been opened, and the set of Scott was only there because it had -probably—belonged to his father, like the bronze copy of the Discus Thrower.</s> <s>And yet he was happier in his Unused room simply because it was his: his possession.</s> <s>I thought with bitterness and envy: if one possesses a thing securely, one need never use it.</s></p>
<p><s>"A whisky?"</s> <s>Henry said.</s> <s>  I remembered his eyes and wondered if he were drinking more than he had done in the old days.</s> <s> Certainly the whiskies he poured out were generous doubles.</s></p>
<p><s>"What's troubling you, Henry?"</s> <s>I asked.</s> <s>I had long abandoned that novel about the senior civil servant: I wasn't looking for copy any longer.</s> <s>"Sarah," he said.</s></p>
<p><s>Would I have been frightened if he had said that, in just that way, two years ago?</s> <s>No, I think I should have been overjoyed—one gets so hopelessly tired of deception I would have welcomed the open fight if only because there might have been a chance, however small, that through some error of tactics on his side I might have won.</s> <s>And there has never been a time in my life before or since when I have so much wanted to win.</s> <s>I have never had so strong a desire even to write a good book.</s></p>
<p><s>He looked up at me with those red-rimmed eyes and said, "Bendrix, I'm afraid."</s> <s>I could no longer patronial him: he was one of misery's graduates: he had passed in the same school, and for the first time I thought of him as an equal.</s> <s>I remember there was one of those early brown photographs in an Oxford frame on his desk, the photograph of his father, and looking at it I thought how like the photograph was to Henry (it had been taken at about the same age, the middle forties) and how unlike It wasn't the moustache that made it different—it was the Victorian look of confidence, of being at home in the world and knowing the way around, and suddenly I felt again that friendly sense of companionship.</s> <s>I liked him better than I would have liked his father (who had been in the Treasury).</s> <s>We were fellow strangers.</s></p>
<p><s>"What is it you're afraid of, Henry?"</s></p>
<p><s>He sat down in an easy chair as though somebody had pushed him and said with disgust, "Bendrix, I've always thought the worst thing, the very worst, a man could do.</s> <s>..."</s> <s>I should certainly have been on tenterhooks in those other days: strange to me, and how infinitely-dreary, the serenity of innocence.</s></p>
<p><s>"You know you can trust me, Henry."</s> <s>It was possible, I thought, that she had kept a letter, though I had written so few.</s> <s>It is a professional risk that authors run.</s> <s>Women are apt to exaggerate the importance of their lovers and they never foresee the disappointing day when an indiscreet letter will appear marked "Interesting" in an autograph catalogue priced at five shillings.</s> <s>"Take a look at this then.</s> <s>Henry said.</s></p>
<p><s>He held a letter out to me: it was not in my handwriting.</s> <s>"Go on.</s> <s>Read it," Henry said.</s> <s>It was from some friend of Henry's and he wrote, "I suggest the man you want to help should apply to a fellow called Savage, 159 Vigo Street.</s> <s>I found him able and discreet, and his employees seemed less nauseous than those chaps usually are."</s></p>

<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.</s> <s>In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels.</s> <s>Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees.</s> <s>The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterwards the road bare and white except for the leaves.</s></p>
<p><s>The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the mountains were brown and bare.</s> <s>There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flashes from the artillery.</s> <s>In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling of a storm coming.</s></p>
<p><s>Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-tractors.</s> <s>There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their pack-saddles and grey motor-trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic.</s> <s>There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the long barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy branches and vines laid over the tractors.</s> <s>To the north we could look across a valley and see a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another mountain on this side of the river.</s> <s>There was fighting for that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain.</s> <s>The vineyards were thin and bare-branched too and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn.</s> <s>There were mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed mud on the roads and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, grey leather boxes heavy with the packs of clips of thin, long 6.5 mm.</s> <s>cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on the road, marched as though they were six months gone with child.</s></p>
<p><s>There were small grey motor-cars that passed going very fast; usually there was an officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in the back seat.</s> <s>They splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of the officers in the back was very small and sitting between two generals, he himself so small that you could not see his face but only the top of his cap and his narrow back, and if the car went especially fast it was probably the King.</s> <s>He lived in Udine and came out in this way nearly every day to see how things were going, and things went very badly.</s></p>
<p><s>At the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain came the cholera.</s> <s>But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the army.</s></p>
<C Chapter 2>
<p><s>The next year there were many victories.</s> <s>The mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine purple on the side of the house.</s> <s>Now the fighting was in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away.</s> <s>The town was very nice and our house was very fine.</s> <s>The river ran behind us and the town had been captured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if the war should end, because they did not bombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way.</s> <s>People lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafes and artillery up side streets and two bawdy-houses, one for troops and one for officers, and with the end of the summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the fighting had been, the trees around the square and the long avenue of trees that led to the square; these with there being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor-car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long-necked body and grey beard like a goat's chin-tuft; all these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing going well on the Carso made the fall very different from the last fall when we had been in the country.</s> <s>The war was changed too.</s></p>
<p><s>The forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the town was gone.</s> <s>The forest had been green in the summer when we had come into the town but now there were the stumps and the broken trunks and the ground torn up, and one day at the end of the fall when I was out where the oak forest had been I saw a cloud coming over the mountain.</s> <s>It came very fast and the sun went a dull yellow and then everything was grey and the sky was covered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in it and it was snow.</s> <s>The snow slanted across the wind, the bare ground was covered, the stumps of trees projected, there was snow on the guns and there were paths in the snow going back to the latrines behind trenches.</s></p>
<p><s>Later, below in the town, I watched the snow falling, looking out of the window of the bawdy-house, the house for officers, where I sat with a friend and two glasses drinking a bottle of Asti, and, looking out at the snow falling slowly and heavily, we knew it was all over for that year.</s> <s>Up the river the mountains had not been taken; none of the mountains beyond the river had been taken.</s> <s>That was all left for next year.</s> <s>My friend saw the priest from our mess going by in the street, walking carefully in the slush, and pounded on the window to attract his attention.</s> <s>The priest looked up.</s> <s>He saw us and smiled.</s> <s>My friend motioned for him to come in.</s> <s>The priest shook his head and went on.</s></p>
<p><s>That night in the mess after the spaghetti course, which every one ate very quickly and seriously, lifting the spaghetti on the fork until the loose strands hung clear then lowering it into the mouth, or else using a continuous lift and sucking into the mouth, helping ourselves to wine from the grass-covered gallon flask; it swung in a metal cradle and you pulled the neck of the flask down with the forefinger and the wine, clear red, tannic and lovely, poured out into the glass held with the same hand; after this course, the captain commenced picking on the priest.</s></p>
<p><s>The priest was young and blushed easily and wore a uniform like the rest of us but with a cross in dark red velvet above the left breast-pocket of his grey tunic.</s> <s>The captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubtful benefit, in order that I might understand perfectly, that nothing should be lost.</s></p>
<p><s>'Priest today with girls,' the captain said looking at the priest and at me.</s> <s>The priest smiled and blushed and shook his head.</s> <s>The captain baited him often.</s></p>
<p><s>'Not true?'</s> <s>asked the captain.</s> <s>'Today I see priest with girls.'</s> <s>'No,' said the priest.</s> <s>The other officers were amused at the baiting.</s></p>
<p><s>'Priest not with girls,' went on the captain.</s> <s>'Priest never with girls,' he explained to me.</s> <s>He took my glass and filled it, looking at my eyes all the time, but not losing sight of the priest.</s></p>
<p><s>'Priest every night five against one,' Every one at the table laughed.</s> <s>'You understand?</s> <s>Priest every night five against one.' He made a gesture and laughed loudly.</s> <s>The priest accepted it as a joke.</s></p>
<p><s>'The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war,' the major said.</s> <s>'He loves Franz Joseph.</s> <s>That's where the money comes from.</s> <s>I am an atheist.'</s></p>
<p><s>'Did you ever read the Black Pig?'</s> <s>asked the lieutenant.</s> <s>'I will get you a copy.</s> <s>It was that which shook my faith.'</s></p>
<p><s>'It is a filthy and vile book,' said the priest.</s> <s>'You do not really like it.'</s></p>
<p><s>'It is very valuable,' said the lieutenant.</s> <s>'It tells you about those priests.</s> <s>You will like it,' he said to me.</s> <s>I smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the candle-light.</s> <s>'Don't you read it,' he said.</s></p>
<p><s>'I will get it for you,' said the lieutenant.</s></p>
<p><s>'All thinking men are atheists,' the major said.</s> <s>'I do not believe in the Freemasons however.'</s></p>
<p><s>'I believe in the Freemasons,' the lieutenant said.</s> <s>It is a noble organization.'</s> <s>Someone came in and as the door opened I could see the snow falling.</s></p>
<p><s>'There will be no more offensive now that the snow has come,' I said.</s></p>
<p><s>'Certainly not,' said the major.</s> <s>'You should go on leave.</s> <s>You should go to Rome, Naples, Sicily - '</p>
<p><s>'He should visit Amalfi,' said the lieutenant.</s> <s>'I will write you cards to my family in Amalfi.</s> <s>They will love you like a son.'</s> <s>'He should go to Palermo.'</s> <s>'He ought to go to Capri.'</s></p>
<p><s>'I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family at Capracotta,' said the priest.</s></p>
<p><s>'Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi.</s> <s>There's more snow there than here.</s> <s>He doesn't want to see peasants.</s> <s>Let him go to centres of culture and civilization.'</s></p>
<p><s>'He should have fine girls.</s> <s>I will give you the addresses of places in Naples.</s> <s>Beautiful young girls - accompanied by their mothers.</s> <s>Ha!</s> <s>Ha!</s> <s>Ha!'</p>
<p><s>He looked at the priest and shouted, 'Every night priest five against one!'</s> <s>They all laughed again.</s></p>
<p><s>'You must go on leave at once,' the major said.</s> <s>'I would like to go with you and show you things,' the lieutenant said.</s></p>
<p><s>'When you come back bring a phonograph.'</s> <s>'Bring good opera disks.'</s> <s>'Bring Caruso.'</s></p>
<p><s>'Don't bring Caruso.</s> <s>He bellows.'</s> <s>'Don't you wish you could bellow like him?'</s> <s>'He bellows.</s> <s>I say he bellows!'</p>
<p><s>'I would like you to go to Abruzzi,' the priest said.</s> <s>The others were shouting.</s> <s>'There is good hunting.</s> <s>You would like the people and though it is cold it is clear and dry.</s> <s>You could stay with my family.</s> <s>My father is a famous hunter.'</s></p>

<p><s>He did not think Miriam would be having a child unless she wanted it.</s> <s>Which should mean the lover intended to marry her.</s> <s>But why had she sent for him?</s> <s>She didn't need him to get a divorce.</s> <s>And why did he go over the same dull ground he had four days ago when he had gotten her letter?</s> <s>The five or six lines in Miriam's round handwriting had said only that she was going to have a child and wanted to see him That she was pregnant guaranteed the divorce, he reasoned, so why was he nervous?</s> <s>A suspicion that he might, in some unreachable depth of himself, be jealous because she was going to bear another man's child and had once aborted his own tormented him above all.</s> <s>No, it was nothing but shame that nettled him, he told himself, shame that he had once loved such a person as Miriam.</s> <s>He mashed his cigarette on the heater's grilled cover.</s> <s>The stub rolled out at his feet, and he kicked it back under the heater.</s></p>
<p><s>There was so much to look forward to now.</s> <s>His divorce, the work in Florida—it was practically certain the board would pass on his drawings, and he would learn this week—and Anne.</s> <s>He and Anne could begin to plan now.</s> <s>For over a year he had been waiting, fretting, for something—this—to happen so he would be free.</s> <s>He felt a pleasant explosion of happiness inside him.</s> <s>and relaxed in the corner of the plush seal.</s> <s>For the last three years, really, he had been waiting for this to happen.</s> <s>He could have bought a divorce, of course, but he hadn't ever amassed that much spare money.</s> <s>Starting a career as an architect, without benefit of a job with a firm, had not been easy and still wasn't.</s> <s>Miriam had never asked for an income, but she plagued him in other ways, by talking of him in Metcalf as if they were still on the best of terms, as if he were up in New York only to establish himself and eventually send for her.</s> <s>Occasionally she wrote him for money, small but irritating amounts which he let her have because it would be so easy for her, so natural to her.</s> <s>to start a campaign in Metcalf against him, and his mother was in Metcalf.</s></p>
<p><s>A tall blond young man in a rust-brown suit dropped into the empty seat opposite Guy and.</s> <s>smiling with a vague friendliness, did over into the corner.</s> <s>Guy glanced at his pallid, undersized face.</s> <s>There was a huge pimple in the exact center of his forehead.</s> <s>Guy looked out the window again.</s></p>
<p><s>The young nun opposite him seemed to debate whether to start a conversation or take a nap.</s> <s>His elbow kept sliding along the window sill, and whenever the stubby lashes came open, the gray bloodshot eyes were looking at him and the soft smile came back.</s> <s>He might have been slightly drunk.</s></p>
<p><s>Guy opened his book, but his mind wandered after half a page.</s> <s>He looked up as the row of white fluorescent lights flickered on down the ceiling of the car, let his eyes wander to the unlighted cigar that still gyrated conversationally in a bony hand behind one of the seat backs, and to the monogram that trembled on a thin gold chain across the tie of the young man opposite him.</s> <s>The monogram was CAB, and the tie was of green silk, hand-painted with offensively orange-colored palm trees.</s> <s>The long rust-brown body was sprawled vulnerably now, the head thrown back so that the big pimple or boil on the forehead might have been a topmost point that had erupted.</s> <s>It was an interesting face, though Guy did not know why.</s> <s>It looked neither young nor old, neither intelligent nor entirely stupid.</s> <s>Between the narrow bulging forehead and the lantern jaw, it scooped degenerately, deep where the mouth lay in a fine line, deepest in the blue hollows that held the small scallops of the lids.</s> <s>The skin was smooth as a girl's, even waxenly clear, as if all its impurities had been drained to feed the pimple's outburst.</s></p>
<p><s>For a few moments, Guy read again.</s> <s>The words made sense to him and began to lift his anxiety.</s> <s>But what good will Plato do you with Miriam, an inner voice asked him.</s> <s>It had asked him that in New York, but he had brought the book anyway, an old text from a high school philosophy course, an indulgence to compensate him, perhaps, for having to make the trip to Miriam.</s></p>
<p><s>He looked out the window and, seeing his own image, straightened his curling collar.</s> <s>Anne was always doing that for him.</s> <s>Suddenly he fell helpless without her.</s> <s>He shifted his position.</s> <s>accidentally touched the outstretched foot of the young man asleep, and watched fascinatedly as the lashes twitched and came open.</s> <s>The bloodshot eyes might have been focused on him all the while through the lids.</s></p>
<p><s>"Sorry."</s> <s>Guy murmured.</s></p>
<p><s>'"S all right."</s> <s>the other said He sat up and shook his head sharply.</s> <s>"Where are we?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Getting into Texas."</s></p>
<p><s>The blond young man brought a gold flask from his inside pocket, opened it.</s> <s>and extended it amiably.</s></p>
<p><s>"No.</s> <s>thanks."</s> <s>Guy said.</s> <s>The woman across the aisle.</s> <s>Guy noticed, who had not looked up from her knitting since St.</s> <s>Louis, glanced over just as the flask upended with a metallic splash</p>
<p><s>"Where you bound?"</s> <s>The smile was a thin wet crescent now.</s></p>
<p><s>"Metcalf."</s> <s>Guy said.</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh.</s> <s>Nice town.</s> <s>Metcalf.</s> <s>Down on business?"</s> <s>He blinked his sore-looking eyes politely.</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"What business?"</s></p>
<p><s>Guy looked up reluctantly from his book.</s> <s>"Architect."</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh."</s> <s>with wistful interest.</s> <s>"Build houses and things?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"I don't think I've introduced myself."</s> <s>He half stood up.</s> <s>"Bruno.</s> <s>Charles Anthony Bruno."</s></p>
<p><s>Guy shook his hand briefly.</s> <s>"Guy Haines."</s></p>
<p><s>"Glad to meet you.</s> <s>You live in New York?"</s> <s>The hoarse baritone voice sounded false, as if he were talking to wake himself up.</s></p>
<p><s>"Yes."</s></p>
<p><s>"I live in Long Island.</s> <s>Going to Santa Fe for a little vacation.</s> <s>Ever been to Santa Fe?"</s></p>
<p><s>Guy shook his head.</s></p>
<p><s>"Great town to relax in."</s> <s>He smiled, showing poor teeth.</s> <s>"Mostly Indian architecture there, I guess."</s></p>
<p><s>A conductor stopped in the aisle, thumbing through tickets.</s> <s>"That your seat?"</s> <s>he asked Bruno.</s></p>
<p><s>Bruno leaned possessively into his corner.</s> <s>"Drawing room next car."</s></p>
<p><s>"Number Three?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I guess.</s> <s>Yeah."</s></p>
<p><s>The conductor went on.</s></p>
<p><s>"Those guys!"</s> <s>Bruno murmured.</s> <s>He leaned forward and gazed out the window amusedly.</s></p>
<p><s>Guy went back to his book, but the other's obtrusive boredom, a feeling he was about to say something in another instant, kept him from concentrating.</s> <s>Guy contemplated going to the diner, but for some reason sat on.</s> <s>The tram was slowing again.</s> <s>When Bruno looked as if he were going to speak, Guy got up, retreated into the next car.</s> <s>and leapt the steps to the crunchy ground before the train had quite stopped.</s></p>
<p><s>The more organic air, weighted with nightfall, struck him like a smothering pillow.</s> <s>There was a smell of dusty, sun-warm gravel, of oil and hot metal.</s> <s>He was hungry and lingered near the diner, pacing in slow strides with his hands in his pockets, breathing the air deeply, though he disliked it.</s> <s>A constellation of red and green and white lights hummed southward in the sky.</s> <s>Yesterday, Anne might have come this route, he thought, on her way to Mexico.</s> <s>He might have been with her.</s> <s>She had wanted him to come with her as far as Mctcalf.</s> <s>He might have asked her to stay over a day and meet his mother, if it had not been for Miriam.</s> <s>Or even regardless of Miriam, if he had been another sort of person, if he could be simply unconcerned.</s> <s>He had told Anne about Miriam, about almost all of it.</s> <s>but he could not bear the thought of their meeting.</s> <s>He had wanted to travel alone on the train in order to think.</s> <s>And what had he thought so far?</s> <s>What good had thinking or logic ever been where Miriam was concerned?</s></p>
<p><s>The conductor's voice shouted a warning, but Guy paced till the last moment, then swung himself aboard the car behind the diner.</s></p>
<p><s>The waiter had just taken his order when the blond young man appeared in the doorway of the car, swaying, looking a little truculent with a short cigarette in his mouth.</s> <s>Guy had put him quite out of mind and now in his tall rust-brown figure was like a vaguely unpleasant memory.</s> <s>Guy saw him smile as he sighted him.</s></p>
<p><s>"Thought you might have missed the train."</s> <s>Bruno said cheerfully, pulling out a chair.</s></p>
<p><s>"If you don't mind, Mr. Bruno.</s> <s>I'd like some privacy for a while.</s> <s>I have some things to think over."</s></p>
<p><s>Bruno stabbed out the cigarette that was burning his ringers and looked at him blankly.</s> <s>He was drunker than before.</s> <s>His face seemed smeared and fuzzy at the edges.</s> <s>"We could have privacy in my place.</s> <s>We could have dinner there.</s> <s>How about it?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Thanks.</s> <s>I'd rather slay here."</s></p>
<p><s>"Oh.</s> <s>but I insist.</s> <s>Waiter!"</s> <s>Bruno clapped his hands.</s> <s>"Would you have this gentleman's order sent to Drawing Room Three and bring me a steak medium rare with French fries and apple pie?</s> <s>And two Scotch and sodas fast as you can.</s> <s>huh?"</s> <s>He looked at Guy and smiled, the soft wistful smile.</s> <s>"Okay?"</s></p>
<p><s>Guy debated, then got up and came with him.</s> <s>What did it matter after all?</s> <s>And wasn't he utterly sick of himself?</s></p>
<p><s>There was no need of the Scotches except to provide glasses and ice.</s> <s>The four yellow-labeled bottles of Scotch lined up on an alligator suitcase were the one neat unit of the little room.</s> <s>Suitcases and wardrobe trunks blocked passage everywhere except for a small labyrinthine area in the center of the floor, and on top of them were strewn sports clothes and equipment, tennis rackets, a bag of golf clubs, a couple of cameras, a wicker basket of fruit and wine bedded in fuchsia paper.</s> <s>A splay of current magazines, comic books and novels covered the seat by the window.</s> <s>There was also a box of candy with a red ribbon across the lid.</s></p>

<C Preface 1>
<p><s>The world has been very kind to this book.</s> <s>The sales of the English editions in their various forms have exceeded a million and a half.</s> <s>In Chicago I was assured many years ago, by an enterprising pirate now retired, that the sales throughout the United States had exceeded a million; and although, in consequence of its having been published before the Copyright Convention, this has brought me no material advantage, the fame and popularity it has won for me among the American public is an asset not to be despised.</s> <s>It has been translated into, I think, every European language, also into some of those of Asia.</s> <s>It has brought me many thousands of letters from young folk, from old folk; from well folk, from sick folk; from merry folk, from sad folk.</s> <s>They have come to me from all parts of the world, from men and women of all countries.</s> <s>Had these letters been the only result I should feel glad that I had written the book.</s> <s>I retain a few blackened pages of one copy sent me by a young colonial officer from South Africa.</s> <s>They were taken from the knapsack of a dead comrade found on Spion Kop.</s> <s>So much for testimonials.</s></p>
<p><s>It remains only to explain the merits justifying such an extraordinary success.</s> <s>I am quite unable to do so.</s> <s>I have written books that have appeared to me more clever, books that have appeared to me more humorous.</s> <s>But it is as the author of Three Men in a Boat (to say nothing of the Dog) that the public persists in remembering me.</s> <s>Certain critics used to suggest that it was the vulgarity of the book, its entire absence of humour, that accounted for its success with the people; but one feels by this time that such a suggestion does not solve the riddle.</s> <s>Bad art may succeed for a time and with a limited public; it does not go on extending its circle throughout nearly half a century.</s></p>
<p><s>I have come to the conclusion that, be the explanation what it may, I can take credit to myself for having written this book.</s> <s>That is, if I did write it.</s> <s>For really I hardly remember doing so.</s> <s>I remember only feeling very young and absurdly pleased with myself for reasons that concern only myself.</s> <s>It was summer time, and London is so beautiful in summer.</s> <s>It lay beneath my window a fairy city veiled in golden mist, for I worked in a room high up above the chimney- pots; and at night the lights shone far beneath me.</s> <s>so that I looked down as into an Aladdin's cave of jewels.</s> <s>It was during those summer months I wrote this book; it seemed the only thing to do.</s></p>
<C Preface 2>
<p><s>The chief beauty of this book lies not so much in íts literary style, or in the extent and usefulness of the information it conveys, as in its simple truthfulness.</s> <s>Its pages form the record of events that really happened.</s> <s>All that has been done is to colour them; and, for this, no extra charge has been made.</s> <s>George and Harris and Montmorency are not poetic ideals, but things of flesh and blood - especially George, who weighs about twelve stone.</s> <s>Other works may excel this in depth of thought and knowledge of human nature: other books may rival it in originality and size; but, for hopeless and incurable veracity, nothing yet discovered can surpass it.</s> <s>This, more than all its other charms, will, it is felt, make the volume precious in the eye of the earnest reader; and will lend additional weight to the lesson that the story teaches.</s></p>
<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>There were four of us - George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency.</s> <s>We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how bad we were - bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.</s></p>
<p><s>We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it.</s> <s>Harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that HE had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what HE was doing.</s> <s>With me, it was my liver that was out of order.</s> <s>I knew it was my liver that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order.</s> <s>I had them all.</s></p>
<p><s>It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form.</s> <s>The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that I have ever felt.</s></p>
<p><s>I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch - hay fever, I fancy it was.</s> <s>I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally.</s> <s>I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into - some fearful, devastating scourge, I know - and, before I had glanced half down the list of "premonitory symptoms," it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.</s></p>
<p><s>I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages.</s> <s>I came to typhoid fever - read the symptoms - discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it - wondered what else I had got; turned up St.</s> <s>Vitus's Dance - found, as I expected, that I had that too, - began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically - read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.</s></p>
<p><s>Bright's disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form, and, so far as that was concerned, I might live for years.</s> <s>Cholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have been born with.</s> <s>I plodded conscientiously through the twenty-six letters, and the only malady I could conclude I had not got was housemaid's knee.</s></p>
<p><s>I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight.</s> <s>Why hadn't I got housemaid's knee?</s> <s>Why this invidious reservation?</s> <s>After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.</s> <s>I reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and I grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid's knee.</s> <s>Gout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without my being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with from boyhood.</s> <s>There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded there was nothing else the matter with me.</s></p>
<p><s>I sat and pondered.</s> <s>I thought what an interesting case I must be from a medical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class!</s> <s>Students would have no need to "walk the hospitals," if they had me.</s> <s>I was a hospital in myself.</s> <s>All they need do would be to walk round me, and, after that, take their diploma.</s></p>
<p><s>Then I wondered how long I had to live.</s> <s>I tried to examine myself.</s> <s>I felt my pulse.</s> <s>I could not at first feel any pulse at all.</s> <s>Then, all of a sudden, it seemed to start off.</s> <s>I pulled out my watch and timed it.</s> <s>I made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute.</s> <s>I tried to feel my heart.</s> <s>I could not feel my heart.</s> <s>It had stopped beating.</s> <s>I have since been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the time, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it.</s> <s>I patted myself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back.</s> <s>But I could not feel or hear anything.</s> <s>I tried to look at my tongue.</s> <s>I stuck it out as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it with the other.</s> <s>I could only see the tip, and the only thing that I could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had scarlet fever.</s></p>
<p><s>I had walked into that reading-room a happy, healthy man.</s> <s>I crawled out a decrepit wreck.</s></p>
<p><s>I went to my medical man.</s> <s>He is an old chum of mine, and feels my pulse, and looks at my tongue, and talks about the weather, all for nothing, when I fancy I'm ill; so I thought I would do him a good turn by going to him now.</s> <s>"What a doctor wants," I said, "is practice.</s> <s>He shall have me.</s> <s>He will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your ordinary, commonplace patients, with only one or two diseases each."</s> <s>So I went straight up and saw him, and he said:</s></p>
<p><s>"Well, what's the matter with you?"</s></p>
<p><s>I said:</s> <s>"I will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what is the matter with me.</s> <s>Life is brief, and you might pass away before I had finished.</s> <s>But I will tell you what is NOT the matter with me.</s> <s>I have not got housemaid's knee.</s> <s>Why I have not got housemaid's knee, I cannot tell you; but the fact remains that I have not got it.</s> <s>Everything else, however, I HAVE got."</s></p>
<p><s>And I told him how I came to discover it all.</s></p>
<p><s>Then he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold of my wrist, and then he hit me over the chest when I wasn't expecting it - a cowardly thing to do, I call it - and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of his head.</s> <s>After that, he sat down and wrote out a prescription, and folded it up and gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.</s></p>
<p><s>I did not open it.</s> <s>I took it to the nearest chemist's, and handed it in.</s> <s>The man read it, and then handed it back.</s></p>
<p><s>He said he didn't keep it.</s></p>
<p><s>I said:</s> <s>"You are a chemist?"</s></p>
<p><s>He said:</s> <s>"I am a chemist.</s> <s>If I was a co-operative stores and family hotel combined, I might be able to oblige you.</s> <s>Being only a chemist hampers me."</s></p>
<p><s>I read the prescription.</s> <s>It ran: 1 lb. beefsteak, with 1 pt. bitter beer every 6 hours. 1 ten-mile walk every morning. 1 bed at 11 sharp every night.</s></p>
<p><s>And don't stuff up your head with things you don't understand."</s></p>
<p><s>I followed the directions, with the happy result - speaking for myself - that my life was preserved, and is still going on.</s></p>
<p><s>In the present instance, going back to the liver-pill circular, I had the symptoms, beyond all mistake, the chief among them being "a general disinclination to work of any kind."</s></p>
<p><s>What I suffer in that way no tongue can tell.</s> <s>From my earliest infancy I have been a martyr to it.</s> <s>As a boy, the disease hardly ever left me for a day.</s> <s>They did not know, then, that it was my liver.</s> <s>Medical science was in a far less advanced state than now, and they used to put it down to laziness.</s></p>
<p><s>"Why, you skulking little devil, you," they would say, "get up and do something for your living, can't you?"</s> <s>- not knowing, of course, that I was ill.</s></p>
<p><s>And they didn't give me pills; they gave me clumps on the side of the head.</s> <s>And, strange as it may appear, those clumps on the head often cured me - for the time being.</s> <s>I have known one clump on the head have more effect upon my liver, and make me feel more anxious to go straight away then and there, and do what was wanted to be done, without further loss of time, than a whole box of pills does now.</s></p>
<p><s>You know, it often is so - those simple, old-fashioned remedies are sometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff.</s></p>
<p><s>We sat there for half-an-hour, describing to each other our maladies.</s> <s>I explained to George and William Harris how I felt when I got up in the morning, and William Harris told us how he felt when he went to bed; and George stood on the hearth-rug, and gave us a clever and powerful piece of acting, illustrative of how he felt in the night.</s></p>
<p><s>George FANCIES he is ill; but there's never anything really the matter with him, you know.</s></p>
<p><s>At this point, Mrs. Poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready for supper.</s> <s>We smiled sadly at one another, and said we supposed we had better try to swallow a bit.</s> <s>Harris said a little something in one's stomach often kept the disease in check; and Mrs. Poppets brought the tray in, and we drew up to the table, and toyed with a little steak and onions, and some rhubarb tart.</s></p>
<p><s>I must have been very weak at the time; because I know, after the first half-hour or so, I seemed to take no interest whatever in my food - an unusual thing for me - and I didn't want any cheese.</s></p>
<p><s>This duty done, we refilled our glasses, lit our pipes, and resumed the discussion upon our state of health.</s> <s>What it was that was actually the matter with us, we none of us could be sure of; but the unanimous opinion was that it - whatever it was - had been brought on by overwork.</s></p>
<p><s>"What we want is rest," said Harris.</s></p>
<p><s>"Rest and a complete change," said George.</s> <s>"The overstrain upon our brains has produced a general depression throughout the system.</s> <s>Change of scene, and absence of the necessity for thought, will restore the mental equilibrium."</s></p>
<p><s>George has a cousin, who is usually described in the charge-sheet as a medical student, so that he naturally has a somewhat family-physicianary way of putting things.</s></p>

<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.</s> <s>In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.</s> <s>They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.</s> <s>They're nice and all — I'm not saying that — but they're also touchy as hell.</s> <s>Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.</s> <s>I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy.</s> <s>I mean that's all I told D.B.</s> <s>about, and he's my brother and all.</s> <s>He's in Hollywood.</s> <s>That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end.</s> <s>He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe.</s> <s>He just got a Jaguar.</s> <s>One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour.</s> <s>It cost him damn near four thousand bucks.</s> <s>He's got a lot of dough, now.</s> <s>He didn't use to.</s> <s>He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home.</s> <s>He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him.</s> <s>The best one in it was 'The Secret Goldfish.'</s> <s>It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money.</s> <s>It killed me.</s> <s>Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute.</s> <s>If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies, Don't even mention them to me.</s></p>
<p><s>Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep.</s> <s>Pencey Prep is this school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania.</s> <s>You probably heard of it.</s> <s>You've probably seen the ads, anyway.</s> <s>They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing somehot-shot guy on a horse jumping over a fence.</s> <s>Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time.</s> <s>I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place.</s> <s>And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: 'Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.1 Strictly for the birds.</s> <s>They don't do any damn more wo/ding at Pencey than they do at any other school.</s> <s>And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all.</s> <s>Maybe two guys.</s> <s>If that many.</s> <s>And they probably came to Pencey that way.</s></p>
<p><s>Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall.</s> <s>The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey.</s> <s>It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win.</s> <s>I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all.</s> <s>You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place.</s> <s>You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.</s></p>
<p><s>There were never many girls at all at the football games.</s> <s>Only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them.</s> <s>It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.</s> <s>I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something.</s> <s>Old Selma Thurmer - she was the headmaster's daughter - showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire.</s> <s>She was a pretty nice girl, though.</s> <s>I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation.</s> <s>I liked her.</s> <s>She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her.</s> <s>What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was.</s> <s>She probably knew what a phony slob he was.</s></p>
<p><s>The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team.</s> <s>I was the goddam manager of the fencing team.</s> <s>Very big deal.</s> <s>We'd gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School.</s> <s>Only, we didn't have the meet.</s> <s>I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway.</s> <s>It wasn't all my fault.</s> <s>I had to keep !</s> <s>ting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to !</s> <s> off.</s> <s>So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime.</s> <s>The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train.</s> <s>It was pretty funny, in a way.</s></p>
<p><s>The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.</s> <s>He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started.</s> <s>He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home.</s> <s>He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey.</s></p>
<p><s>I forgot to tell you about that.</s> <s>They kicked me out.</s> <s>I wasn't supposed to come back after Christmas vacation, on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all.</s> <s>They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself — especially around mid-terms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer — but I didn't do it.</s> <s>So I got the ax.</s> <s>They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey.</s> <s>It has a very good academic rating, Pencey.</s> <s>It really does.</s> <s>Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill.</s> <s>I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything.</s> <s>The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all.</s> <s>Pencey was full of crooks.</s> <s>Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway.</s> <s>The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has - I'm not kidding.</s> <s>Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off.</s> <s>Only, I wasn't watching the game too much.</s> <s>What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by.</s> <s>I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them.</s> <s>I hate that.</s> <s>I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it.</s> <s>If you don't, you feel even worse.</s></p>
<p><s>I was lucky.</s> <s>All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was !</s> <s>ting the hell out.</s> <s>I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building.</s> <s>They were nice guys, especially Tichener.</s> <s>It was just before dinner and it was !</s> <s>ting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway.</s> <s>It kept !</s> <s>ting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing.</s> <s>Finally we had to.</s> <s>This teacher that taught biology, Mr Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and !</s> <s> ready for dinner.</s> <s>If I !</s> <s> a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can !</s> <s> a good-by when I need one - at least, most of the time I can.</s> <s>As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's house.</s> <s>He didn't live on the campus.</s> <s>He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.</s></p>
<p><s>I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath.</s> <s>I have no wind, if you want to know the truth.</s> <s>I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing — that is, I used to be.</s> <s>They made me cut it out.</s> <s>Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year.</s> <s>That's also how I practically got t.b.</s> <s>and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff.</s> <s>I'm pretty healthy, though.</s></p>
<p><s>Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 2.04.</s> <s>It was icy as hell and I damn near fell down.</s> <s>I don't even know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it.</s> <s>After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.</s> <s>It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.</s></p>
<p><s>Boy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house.</s></p>
<p><s>I was really frozen.</s> <s>My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all.</s> <s>'C'mon, c'mon,' I said right out loud, almost, 'somebody open the door.'</s> <s>Finally old Mrs Spencer opened it.</s> <s>They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves.</s> <s>They didn't have too much dough.</s></p>
<p><s>'Holden!' Mrs Spencer said.</s> <s>'How lovely to see you!</s> <s>Come in, dear!</s> <s>Are you frozen to death?'</s> <s>I think she was glad to see me.</s> <s>She liked me.</s> <s>At least, I think she did.</s></p>
<p><s>Boy, did I !</s> <s> in that house fast.</s> <s>'How are you, Mrs Spencer?'</s> <s>I said.</s> <s>'How's Mr Spencer?'</s></p>
<p>'Let me take your coat, dear,' she said.</s> <s>She didn't hear me ask her how Mr Spencer was.</s> <s>She was sort of deaf.</s></p>
<p><s>She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand.</s> <s>I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much.</s> <s>'How've you been, Mrs Spencer?'</s> <s>I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me.</s></p>
<p><s>'I've been just fine, Holden.'</s> <s>She closed the closet door 'How have you been?'</s> <s>The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked out, 'Fine,' I said.</s> <s>'How's Mr Spencer?</s> <s>He over his grippe yet?'</p>
<p><s>'Over it!</s> <s>Holden, he's behaving like a perfect - I don't know what...</s> <s>He's in his room, dear.</s> <s>Go right in.'</s></p>

<p><s>When the doorbell rings while Nero Wolfe and I are at dinner, in the old brownstone house on West Thirty-fifth Street, ordinarily it is left to Fritz to answer it.</s> <s>But that evening I went myself, knowing that Fritz was in no mood to handle a caller, no matter who it was.</s></p>
<p><s>Fritz's mood should be explained.</s> <s>Each year around the middle of May, by arrangement, a farmer who lives up near Brewster shoots eighteen or twenty starlings, puts them in a hag, and gets in his car and drives to New York.</s> <s>It is understood that they are to be delivered to our door within two hours after they were winged.</s> <s>Fritz dresses them and sprinkles them with salt, and, at the proper moment, brushes them with melted butter, wraps them in sage leaves, grills them, and arranges them on a platter of hot polenta, which is thick porridge of fine-ground yellow cornmeal with butter, grated cheese, and salt and pepper.</s></p>
<p><s>It is an expensive meal and a happy one, and Wolfe always looks forward to it, but that day he put on an exhibition.</s> <s>When the platter was brought in, steaming, and placed before him, he sniffed, ducked his head and sniffed again, and straightened to look up at Fritz.</s></p>
<p><s>"The sage?"</s></p>
<p><s>"No, sir."</s></p>
<p><s>"What do you mean, no, sir?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I thought you might like it once in a style I have suggested, with saffron and tarragon.</s> <s>Much fresh tarragon, with just a touch of saffron, which is the way—"</p>
<p><s>"Remove it!"</s></p>
<p><s>Fritz went rigid and his lips tightened.</s></p>
<p><s>"You did not consult me," Wolfe said coldly.</s> <s>"To find that without warning one of my favorite dishes has been radically altered is an unpleasant shock.</s> <s>It may possibly be edible, but I am in no humor to risk it.</s> <s>Please dispose of it and bring me four coddled eggs and a piece of toast."</s></p>
<p><s>Fritz, knowing Wolfe as well as I did, aware that this was a stroke of discipline that hurt Wolfe more than it did him and that it would be useless to try to parley, reached for the platter, but I put in, "I'll take some if you don't mind.</s> <s>If the smell won't keep you from enjoying your eggs?"</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe glared at me.</s></p>
<p><s>That was how Fritz acquired the mood that made me think it advisable for me to answer the door.</s> <s>When the bell rang Wolfe had finished his eggs and was drinking coffee, really a pitiful sight, and I was toward the end of a second helping of the starlings and polenta, which was certainly edible.</s> <s>Going to the hall and the front, I didn't bother to snap the light switch because there was still enough twilight for me to see, through the one-way glass panel, that the customer on the stoop was not our ship coming in.</s></p>
<p><s>I pulled the door open and told him politely, "Wrong number."</s></p>
<p><s>I was polite by policy, my established policy of promoting the idea of peace on earth with the neighborhood kids.</s> <s>It made life smoother in that street, where there was a fair amount of ball throwing and other activities.</s></p>
<p><s>"Guess again," he told me in a low nervous alto, not too rude.</s> <s>"You're Archie Goodwin.</s> <s>I've gotta see Nero Wolfe."</s></p>
<p><s>"What's your name?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Pete."</s></p>
<p><s>"What's the rest of it?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Drossos.</s> <s>Pete Drossos."</s></p>
<p><s>"What do you want to sec Mr. Wolfe about?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I gotta case.</s> <s>I'll tell him."</s></p>
<p><s>He was a wiry little specimen with black hair that needed a trim and sharp black eyes, the top of his head coming about level with the knot of my four-in-hand.</s> <s>I had seen him around the neighborhood but had nothing either for or against him.</s> <s>The thing was to ease him off without starting a feud, and ordinarily I would have gone at it, but after Wolfe's childish performance with Fritz I thought it would do him good to have another child to play with.</s> <s>Naturally he would snarl and snap, but if Pete got scratched I could salve him afterward.</s> <s>So I invited him in and escorted him to the dining room.</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe was refilling his coffee cup.</s> <s>He shot a glance at Pete, who I admit was not dressed up, put the pot down, looked straight at me, and spoke.</s></p>
<p><s>"Archie.</s> <s>I will not have interruptions at meals."</s></p>
<p><s>I nodded sympathetically.</s> <s>"I know, but this wasn't a meal.</s> <s>Call eggs a meal?</s> <s>This is Mr. Peter Drossos.</s> <s>He wants to consult you about a case.</s> <s>I was going to tell him you're busy, but I remembered you got sore because Fritz didn't consult you, and I didn't want you to get sore at Pete too.</s> <s>He's a neighbor of ours, and you know, love thy neighbor as thyself."</s></p>
<p><s>Ragging Wolfe is always a gamble.</s> <s>A quick reflex explosion may split the air, but if it doesn't, if he takes a second for a look at it, you're apt to find yourself topped.</s> <s>That time he took several seconds, sipping coffee, and then addressed our caller courteously.</s> <s>"Sit down, Mr. Drossos."</s></p>
<p><s>"I'm not mister, I'm Pete."</s></p>
<p><s>"Very well, Pete, sit down.</s> <s>Turn more to face me, please.</s> <s>Thank you.</s> <s>You wish to consult me?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yeah, I gotta case."</s></p>
<p><s>"I always welcome a case, but the timing is a little unfortunate because Mr. Goodwin was going out this evening to see a billiard match, and now of course he will have to stay here to take down all that you say and all that I say.</s> <s>Archie, get your notebook, please?"</s></p>
<p><s>As I said, it's always a gamble.</s> <s>He had his thumb in my eye.</s> <s>I went across the hall to the office for a notebook and pen, and when I returned Fritz was there with coffee for me and cookies and a bottle of Coke for Pete.</s> <s>I said nothing.</s> <s>My pen and notebook would do the recording almost automatically, needing about a fifth of my brain, and I would see the rest of it devising plans for getting from under.</s></p>
<p><s>Pete was talking.</s> <s>"I guess it's okay him taking it down, but I gotta watch my end.</s> <s>This is strictly under the lid."</s></p>
<p><s>"If you mean it's confidential, certainly."</s></p>
<p><s>"Then I'll spill it.</s> <s>I know there's some private eyes you can't open up to, but you're different.</s> <s>We know all about you around here.</s> <s>I know how you feel about the lousy cops, just like I do.</s> <s>So I'll lay it out."</s></p>
<p><s>"Please do."</s></p>
<p><s>"Okay.</s> <s>What time is it?"</s></p>
<p><s>I looked at my wrist watch.</s> <s>"Ten to eight."</s></p>
<p><s>"Then it happened an hour ago.</s> <s>I know sometimes everything hangs on the time element, and right after it happened I went and looked at the clock in the drugstore near the corner, and it was a quarter to seven.</s> <s>I was working the wipe racket there at the corner of Thirty-fifth and Ninth, and a Caddy stopped—"</p>
<p><s>"Please.</s> <s>What's the wipe racket?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Why, you know, a car stops for the light and you hop to it with a rag and start wiping the window, and if it's a man and he lets you go on to the windshield you've got him for at least a dime.</s> <s>If it's a woman and she lets you go on, maybe you've got her and maybe not.</s> <s>That's a chance you take.</s> <s>Well, this Caddy stopped—"</p>
<p><s>"What's a Caddy?"</s></p>
<p><s>From the look that appeared in the sharp black eyes, Pete was beginning to suspect that he had picked the wrong private eye.</s> <s>I cut in to show him that anyhow one of us wasn't a moron, telling Wolfe, "A Cadillac automobile."</s></p>
<p><s>"I see.</s> <s>It stopped?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Yeah, for the light.</s> <s>I went for the window by the driver.</s> <s>It was a woman.</s> <s>She turned her face around to me to look straight at me and she said something.</s> <s>I don't think she made any sound, or anyway if she did I didn't hear anything through the window because it was up nearly to the top, but she worked her lips with it and I could tell what it was.</s> <s>She said, 'Help.</s> <s>Get a cop.'</s> <s>Like this, look."</s></p>
<p><s>He reached in his pants pocket, pulled out a little scrap of paper, and read from it: "Connecticut, Y,Y, nine, four, three, two."</s></p>
<p><s>"Excellent."</s> <s>Wolfe returned his empty cup to the saucer.</s> <s>"Have you given that to the police?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Me?"</s> <s>Pete was scornful.</s> <s>"The cops?</s> <s>Look, am I screwy?</s> <s>I go to the precinct and tell a flattie, or even say I get to a sarge and tell him, and what?</s> <s>First he don't believe me and then he chases me and then I'm marked.</s> <s>It don't hurt you to be marked, because you're a private eye with a license and you've got something on a lot of inspectors."</s></p>
<p><s>"I have?</s> <s>What?"</s></p>
<p><s>"Don't ask me.</s> <s>But everybody knows you're loaded with dirt on some big boys or you'd have been rubbed out long ago.</s> <s>But a kid like me can't risk it to be marked even if I'm straight.</s> <s>I hate cops, but you don't have to be a crook to hate cops.</s> <s>I keep telling my mother I'm straight, and I am straight, but I'm telling you it takes a lot of guts.</s> <s>What do you think of this case I got?"</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe considered.</s> <s>"It seems a little—uh—hazy."</s></p>
<p><s>"Yeah, that's why I came to you.</s> <s>I went to a place I go to when I want to think, and I went all over it.</s> <s>I saw it was a swell case if I handled it right.</s> <s>The car was a Caddy, a dark gray fifty-two Caddy.</s> <s>The man looked mean, but he looked like dough, he looked like he might have two or three more Caddies.</s> <s>The woman did too.</s> <s>She wasn't as old as my mother, but I guess I can't go by that because my mother has done a lot of hard work, and I bet she never did work.</s> <s>She had a scratch on her face, on her left cheek, and her face was all twisted saying that to me, 'Help, get a cop'; but, thinking it over, I decided she was a good-looker.</s> <s>She had big gold spiders for earrings, spiders with their legs stretched out.</s> <s>Pure gold."</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe grunted.</s></p>
<p><s>"Okay," Pete conceded, "they looked like gold.</s> <s>They wasn't brass.</s> <s>Anyhow, the whole layout said dough, and what I was thinking went like this: I got a case with people with dough, and how do I handle it so I'll get some?</s> <s>There might be up to fifty dollars in it if I handle it right.</s> <s>If he kills her I can identify him and get the reward.</s> <s>I can tell what she said to me and how he jabbed the gun in her—"</p>
<p><s>"You didn't see a gun."</s></p>
<p><s>"That's a detail.</s> <s>If he didn't kill her, if he just made her do something or tell him something or give him something, I can go and put it up to him, either he comes across with fifty bucks, or maybe a hundred, or I hang it on him."</s></p>
<p><s>"That would be blackmail."</s></p>
<p><s>"Okay."</s> <s>Pete brushed cookie crumbs from his fingers onto the tray.</s> <s>"That's why I decided I had to see you after I thought it over.</s> <s>I saw I couldn't handle it alone and I'd have to cut you in, but you understand it's my case.</s> <s>Maybe you think I was a sap to tell you that license number before we made a deal, but I don't.</s> <s>If you get onto him and comer him and try to cross me and hog it, I'll still have to identify him, so it will be up to me.</s> <s>If blackmail's out, you can figure it so it's not blackmail.</s> <s>What do you say we split fifty-fifty?"</s></p>
<p><s>"I'll tell you, Pete."</s> <s>Wolfe pushed his chair back and got his bulk comfortably settled in a new position.</s> <s>"If we are to join hands on your case I think I should tell you a few things about the science and art of detection.</s> <s>Mr. Goodwin will of course take it down, and when he types it he will make a copy for you.</s> <s>But first he'll make a phone call.</s> <s>Archie, you have that license number.</s> <s>Call Mr. Cramer's office and give them that number.</s> <s>Say that you have information that that car, or its owner or operator, may have been involved in a violation of a law in this city in the past two hours, and suggest a routine check.</s> <s>Do not be more definite.</s> <s>Say that our information is unverified and inquiry should be discreet."</s></p>
<p><s>"Hey," Pete demanded, "who's Mr. Cramer?</s> <s>A cop?"</s></p>
<p><s>"A police inspector," Wolfe told him.</s> <s>"You yourself suggested the possibility of murder.</s> <s>If there was a murder there is a corpse.</s> <s>If there is a corpse it should be found.</s> <s>Unless and until it is found, where's your case?</s> <s>We have no idea where to look for it, so we'll trick the police into finding it for us.</s> <s>I often make use of them that way.</s> <s>Archie.</s> <s>Of course you will not mention Pete's name, since he doesn't want to be marked."</s></p>
<p><s>As I went across to the office, to my desk, and dialed the number of Manhattan Homicide West, I was reflecting that of all Wolfe's thousand techniques for making himself obnoxious the worst was when he thought he was being funny.</s> <s>When I finished talking to Sergeant Purlcy Stebbins and hung up, I was tempted to just walk out and go up to watch Mosconi and Watrous handle their cues, but of course that wouldn't do because it would have been admitting he had called me good, and he would merely have shooed Pete out and settled down with a book and a satisfied smirk.</s></p>
<p><s>So I marched back to the dining room, sat down and took up my pen, and said brightly, "All right, they're alerted.</s> <s>Shoot the lecture on detection, and don't leave anything out."</s></p>
<p><s>Wolfe leaned back, put his elbows on the chair arms, and matched his fingertips.</s> <s>"You understand, Pete, that I shall confine myself to the problems and methods of the private detective who works at his profession for a living."</s></p>

<p><s>It's all settled then - this really does seem likely to prove a war that ends before Christmas.</s> <s>Any day now Bin Laden should be blown up in a cave, and then we can settle down to our turkey and Christmas pudding.</s> <s>We can send cards and sing carols about peace and goodwill without a chorus of daisy cutters in the background.</s> <s>Christmas is a time when, above all else, we like to feel good about ourselves; we give to charities, we give presents, we offer hospitality and we remember those lonely old relatives.</s> <s>If it works, the objective is to feel expansive, warm-hearted and generous.</s> <s>So all good wars must end before Christmas.</s></p>
<p><s>Indeed, this one is shaping up in every respect to having been a jolly good war.</s> <s>It is fitting all the criteria for what a modern war should be - very neatly.</s> <s>It's been short; it's been successful; and we've had right on our side.</s> <s>Not a day is going by without another al-Qaida bomb factory or terror manual being discovered; and now an Advent goodie, the smoking gun himself, Bin Laden, chortling as only an evil genius would do over his handiwork.</s> <s>Even the ascetic Mullah Omar comes in for demonisation as his vast compound in Kandahar allegedly exposes his corrupt egotism while his people suffered in poverty (worst of all, it appears, he had execrable taste in interior decor).</s></p>
<p><s>So this year, as we pull the crackers, we can happily reflect on the fact that those dear Afghans are now flying their kites and listening to their screeching music (though it's a mystery as to why they would want to) once again, thanks to us.</s> <s>To top it all, feeling really good usually requires some measure of feeling superior; so round off that seasonal glow with some gloating at the idiots who opposed this war.</s></p>
<p><s>All so neat, just too neat, and I don't buy it.</s> <s>The coverage of this war raises more questions than any other war I can remember (and I'm not even talking about the video tape).</s> <s>Of much more concern has been the way the coverage has been heavily skewed towards the military conflict: it's been a boys' war.</s> <s>We've followed planes and bombs, we've watched plumes of smoke from distant brown hills, we've seen picturesque Afghan fighters hanging about in mountain hideouts - and now it has culminated in a grand finale, a mountain shoot-out.</s> <s>It's been as gripping and as plausible as one of the black-and-white westerns 0 we'll watch this Christmas, only fewer dead bodies.</s> <s>0 Very occasionally, we've glimpsed that people are getting killed - the images of the castrated Taliban fighter pleading for his life before he was shot, and the massacre at Qala-i-Janghi.</s> <s>But our sympathy for these near-feral wildmen is limited - they got what they deserved, they were Taliban after all.</s></p>
<p><s>What has been strikingly absent is the humanisation of this war.</s> <s>Unlike in Bosnia and Kosovo, our screens and newspapers have not been filled with the terrible trauma of recognisable individuals and their families.</s> <s>The cameras haven't hovered on the faces of shocked tearful children, and the impotent anguish of their parents and grandparents.</s> <s>On a few occasions, reporters have reached a bombed village, but it's hard to tell the rubble from the hovels, and estimates of the dead are always circumspect; there has been no sense of outrage about these atrocities.</s> <s>Yet the number of Afghan non-combatants reported killed (how many more do we not know about?) in this war is edging close to those who died in the World Trade Centre.</s> <s>The latter has provoked global outrage, the former is accepted with an astonishing equanimity as a necessary price to pay for two very uncertain prognostications - Afghanistan's peaceful future and ridding the world of the evil al-Qaida.</s></p>
<p><s>But the even bigger story that has barely surfaced in recent weeks is the huge dislocation the war has caused to the entire population.</s> <s>The World Food Programme estimates that as many as 3m-4m people have fled their homes because of the bombing.</s> <s>Médecins Sans Frontières claims that Maslakh - a name that should be on every newspaper front page - is the biggest refugee camp in the world.</s> <s>The few aid workers there haven't even been able to assess its population, which is believed to be somewhere between 200,000 and 800,000 and growing; new arrivals have recently shot up from 20 a day to 1,200.</s> <s>It is one of five refugee camps around Herat, but the route there is too insecure for western journalists.</s> <s>0 They are largely sticking to the main cities and Tora Bora (there are a few notable exceptions, such as the Sunday Telegraph's Christina Lamb, who sent a horrifying report from Maslakh).</s></p>
<p><s>But it's not even those dusty, cold refugee camps that are the WFP's biggest headache, according to its Rome spokesman: at least 0 it knows where they are.</s> <s>It is the refugees who have fled into remote rural areas, many of whom could die - or may already have died - a bitter death from starvation and cold this winter.</s></p>
<p><s>Part of the explanation for why we are not hearing this is the unprecedented danger of reporting this war, in which as many journalists as western combatants have been killed.</s> <s>Partly it's because journalists always depend for help on local participants in a war who want to use the western media to advance their cause.</s> <s>But the only Afghans helping western journalists are the Northern Alliance, and they have no interest in shocking a western public with the suffering caused by the bombing.</s></p>
<p><s>Meanwhile, the Taliban were hopelessly ignorant.</s> <s>They always buried the bodies too quickly for western cameras.</s> <s>Just compare them with the Kosovo Liberation Army, which ensured a storm of western moral outrage at Serbian ethnic cleansing by taking the cameras to remote villages to show them the dead bodies.</s> <s>Nor did the Afghans flee into Pakistan in sufficient numbers to provide the kind of disaster footage always inexplicably described as "biblical".</s></p>
<p><s>All of this has conveniently dovetailed with the west's pursuit of this war.</s> <s>So we've been left with a straightforward moral narrative: good triumphs over evil.</s> <s>It's been this kind of easy moralising that kicked me into the idiots' camp from the start.</s> <s>The US may have wanted to exact revenge, but it was never something anyone could claim to be morally right.</s> <s>The Americans have unleashed a principle of foreign policy - it is legitimate to fight terror with even greater terror - that is causing havoc in the Middle East, could cause more havoc in Kashmir and is being used from China to Zimbabwe to warrant brutal repression.</s></p>
<p><s>The fact that it hasn't yet caused the kind of havoc feared in Afghanistan (such as a protracted guerrilla war) is small recompense when we choose to overlook that we are not getting anything like the full picture of the suffering it has caused in this most tragic of countries.</s></p>

<p><s>Twenty months ago the American public could rejoice in their nation's good fortune, geographical location and material resources, technological prowess and sheer military clout, all of which combined to make the United States the most powerful and influential nation the world had known since Imperial Rome, relative to other states.</s> <s>The Soviet Union had collapsed, and its Russian successor was slowly imploding.</s> <s>The Japanese ``challenge'' had evaporated.</s> <s>The world was embracing American-style capitalism, the Internet, MTV and the expectations of Wall Street.</s></p>
<p><s>The 21st century, one rosy-tinted book had confidently asserted even a decade earlier, ``will be American.''</s> <s>That confidence evaporated amid the smoke plumes that arose from the damaged Pentagon and the collapsed World Trade Towers.</s> <s>It is hardly likely to return in the near future, or ever.</s></p>
<p><s>No sooner had the news networks screened that amazing clip of the second aircraft diving into the south building than Americans began to think of Pearl Harbor, an earlier surprise attack upon this nation that shook it out of its complacency and sense of innocence and security.</s> <s>But the Pearl Harbor analogy is useful only to be held up in contrast to what happened earlier this week.</s></p>
<p><s>Although Americans 60 years ago were shocked to their knees, the policy response to that sneak attack was both obvious and feasible.</s> <s>The military aircraft of another sovereign state, Japan, had struck the military aircraft and warships of America.</s> <s>In response, the United States launched a primarily military campaign on land, sea and air to defeat its recognizable enemy; and since the American GDP at that time was about 10 times that of Japan's, the eventual outcome of this unequal conflict could be foreseen.</s> <s>An angry and fully mobilized America smote its underhanded foe, and unconditional victory was achieved.</s> <s>And this, of course, is what American citizens expect will happen in response to Tuesday's terrorist attacks.</s> <s>Stores and homes have put up placards saying ``Mr.</s> <s>President, Bomb Them NOW!'' But it is precisely here that the Pearl Harbor analogy peters out.</s></p>
<p><s>This time around America has not been struck by another state's military aircraft but by its own, hijacked civilian planes -- with devilish symbolism, planes that belonged to American Airlines and United Airlines, the two largest and best-known U.S.</s> <s>carriers.</s> <s>The attacks were perpetrated by incredibly well-organized terrorists who exploited America's strengths -- its technology, its open society, its easily accessible airlines, even its television networks -- to strike fear and sow confusion.</s> <s>And this enemy is shady, de-centralized, not easily identifiable and certainly not very easy to destroy.</s></p>
<p><s>Defeating Japan was like shooting an elephant; defeating the terrorists who inflicted these wounds upon America is like stomping on jellyfish.</s> <s>The impudence and the irony of the attack can escape no one.</s></p>
<p><s>Just a few weeks ago, I did some recalculations of U.S.</s> <s>``power'' today, as measured by the standard social science criteria, and the overwhelming impression that emerged was of how far this single nation stood above all possible contenders as the global hegemon.</s> <s>True, America contains only about 4.5 percent of the world's total population, but sheer numbers of human beings are rarely a good indicator of comparative heft.</s> <s>By comparison, it possesses approximately 30 percent of total world product, a percentage that has actually increased in recent years because of the paralysis of Russia's economy and the languishing of Japan's.</s> <s>Even more remarkable is the size of the American military preeminence.</s></p>
<p><s>Last year, fully 36 percent of all the world's military spending was done by the Pentagon; in fact, the U.S.</s> <s>defense budget was equal to the defense budgets of the next (ital) nine (unital) largest military spenders, a statistic that (so far as I can judge) has never before existed in all of history.</s> <s>Comparative technological and education/science indicators further increased America's lead; its share of world Internet traffic is around 40 percent, its share of Nobel prize winners (1975-2000) is around 70 percent.</s> <s>Putting these measures of comparative national power together presents an awesome amalgam.</s> <s>Truly, America is our modern-day Colossus, bestriding the world with its aircraft-carriers, communications systems, giant corporations and heavy cultural impress.</s> <s>And yet this Colossus is also extremely vulnerable to weapons that are far different from Yamamoto's aircraft carriers and Hitler's panzer divisions.</s></p>
<p><s>It has an Achilles' heel that is, to a great extent, of its own making.</s> <s>Its cultural and commercial superiority and the relentless drumbeat of its free-market doctrines have been seen as a threat to many religious and class groups, especially in traditional societies.</s> <s>Its powerful corporations are viewed by America's critics as having an undue and powerful influence, say, in blocking international agreements on climate control, in forcing changes upon restricted markets, in overawing weak Third World governments.</s> <s>Its strong support of Israel -- to an extent that would have astonished, say, U.S.</s> <s>President Dwight Eisenhower -- gives it enemies across the Muslim world.</s> <s>Its invention of the Internet and its prominent role in creating 24-hour-a-day trading markets make it immensely wealthy but also incredibly vulnerable to sabotage.</s> <s>Its liberal immigration policies (at least as compared to Europe's) and the openness of its universities to foreign students mean that it contains a vast melting pot of individuals from all over the world, some of whom may be suborned for terrorist acts.</s> <s>(It has been reported that some suicide pilots trained in the United States.)</p>
<p><s>This is not Fortress America at all; in fact, it is the very opposite.</s> <s>This contradiction between the appearance of unchallenged American might abroad and the reality of grappling with the ``new'' security threat of terrorism at home was perhaps nowhere better captured this past week by reports that three U.S.</s> <s>carrier task groups were headed into the waters off the East Coast.</s> <s>In many ways, such a group of powerful modern warships (each would contain a massive aircraft carrier with more than 100 aircraft, an Aegis cruiser, several destroyers and a submarine) represents the most overpowering sign of America's global reach, thousands of miles from their home bases; these are the forces that cruise off the Taiwan Strait, or patrol the lower reaches of the Persian Gulf.</s> <s>No other navy's forces can take them on.</s> <s>But this week they scurried home, though their mission was unclear.</s> <s>Would they fly patrols over the White House, or rescue survivors from the World Trade Center?</s> <s>At any rate, these were not missions for which they were originally designed.</s> <s>This brings us, then, to the critical question of whether America's (and, more generally, the West's) armed forces are ready for the possible security threats of the new century.</s></p>
<p><s>For the past 10 to 20 years, growing numbers of experts in international affairs and military relations have suggested that the Pentagon had been too focused on World War II/Cold War stereotypes of fighting, but very reluctant to take seriously alternative views of both the sources of conflict and the changed nature of struggles.</s></p>
<p><s>No one can say that there will never again be Nazi-like aggression by one state against its neighbors, and it is prudent to keep efficient armed forces as an insurance policy and to make the international security mechanisms like NATO and the U.N.</s> <s>Security Council as robust as possible.</s> <s>But main battle tanks and carrier task forces are not much help against such sources of instability and conflict as population pressures, illegal mass migrations, environmental disasters, malnutrition and human-rights abuses -- conditions we have seen so often in Africa, the Balkans, Haiti and the Middle East, and in which young recruits for suicide-bombing and other terrorist acts can be found.</s></p>
<p><s>Moreover, the U.S.'</s> <s>multibillion-dollar large weapons platforms are also not much use in the battle against international crime and/or drug cartels.</s> <s>Finally, they really are of only moderate utility in combating the acts of terrorism which we witnessed on Tuesday.</s> <s>No one doubts that Osama bin Laden and fellows will be pursued, and that smart bombs will be sent into hillsides and caves; but the terrorist organizations have a loose cell-like structure and no real headquarters, new successors will emerge to lead those cells, and fresh youths are waiting to join in the fight.</s></p>
<p><s>Both President George W.</s> <s>Bush and the American media have this week made references to ``hunting down'' the perpetrators, as if the terrorists were like bank robbers in the Wild West who had galloped off into the Montana hills and were being followed by the sheriff.</s> <s>If only it were that easy.</s> <s>Thus, the chief weapons and force structures that the Pentagon has invested in are neither helpful in reducing the sources of instability in today's world, or in preventing determined suicide bombers from doing damage, or in exterminating the terrorist threat.</s></p>
<p><s>This conclusion is neither shocking nor new.</s> <s>After all, at the beginning of the year former Sens.</s> <s>Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, who head the U.S.</s> <s>Commission on National Security, issued a thoughtful report about threats to American national security that explicitly called for greater attention to be paid to these newer forms of danger and for the defense forces to be restructured accordingly.</s> <s>Alas, at that time, policy-makers and strategists were concentrating their attention on the president's campaign to get acceptance of his national missile defense, and Hart-Rudman was mostly ignored.</s></p>
<p><s>Given the severity of Tuesday's catastrophes and the desire of all Americans to show solidarity, no one has yet been impolite enough to ask the president or Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to explain how spending $80 billion on a shield against incoming ballistic missiles could have defended the World Trade Center.</s></p>
<p><s>But the time for such questions will undoubtedly come -- and soon.</s> <s>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that not only is the threat of terrorist attacks not going to go away, but also that we are not going to be very successful in preventing them.</s> <s>The genie is out of the bottle with a vengeance; the car-bomb has now become the plane-bomb.</s> <s>Worse still, if the terrorist world rejoices at the deaths of thousands and thousands of innocent Americans, why should we imagine that crashing an aircraft is the worst blow that totally ruthless and well-organized villainy can deliver?</s> <s>How far away are we from an atrocity like setting off a small atom bomb in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or spreading anthrax through the San Francisco subway system?</s></p>
<p><s>That pleasant, kindly Norman Rockwell age of the 1930s, when Americans felt safe and good about themselves, was already shaken at Pearl Harbor.</s> <s>Tuesday it was blown to pieces, just like the two skyscrapers.</s> <s>This is not what Americans like to hear.</s> <s>This sounds too pessimistic, too defeatist.</s> <s>The calls on all sides are for swift, retributive action, and they are natural enough, given the horrors we have suffered.</s></p>
<p><s>The American culture celebrates quick and decisive blows, clear-cut victories, and lots and lots of freedoms: freedom from government, freedom from taxes, freedom from international governance, freedom to drive enormous gas-guzzling cars and to demand cheap petroleum, freedom to walk on and off an aircraft with lots of hand-baggage, freedom to be completely safe and secure from external troubles.</s> <s>The weariness and the wariness that characterize the inhabitants of Belfast or Jerusalem or Kashmir are things that most Americans have never experienced and which I suspect they are psychologically unprepared to handle.</s></p>
<p><s>All of this leaves the political leaders of this vast, complex democracy with a problem that, so far at least, they have not honestly addressed.</s> <s>They have not said, pace Winston Churchill, that they only offer blood, sweat, toil and tears.</s> <s>They have not said that this new foe can probably hurt Americans much more than Americans can hurt them.</s> <s>They have not said that the old verities may be no more, and the old ways of military effectiveness and strategy may be over.</s> <s>They have not cautioned that America's traditional home liberties may never be the same again.</s> <s>They have not said that, on Tuesday, Sept.</s> <s>11, the United States got a glimpse of what the 21st century may hold for all of us, and that the way ahead may be tougher and rockier than the collapse of buildings in Wall Street and a glancing blow to the Pentagon.</s></p>
<T Osama>
<p><s>It's been a nervous week.</s> <s>Every night before bed, I've taken a broom handle and thrust it under my bed.</s> <s>Each time, I'm waiting for the "Oof!"</s> <s>Osama is under there, I just know it.</s> <s>If the President says it, it must be true, right?</s> <s>One of these nights, I'll bust that Osama in the ribs with my handle.</s> <s>Just you wait.</s> <s>I'm keeping my feet under the covers, though.</s> <s>You know, just in case.</s></p>
<p><s>It happens like clockwork these days: A significant piece of legislation comes before Congress that was ostensibly drafted to help defend the nation against terrorism.</s> <s>Line items within the legislation do away with previously sacrosanct personal freedoms outlined within the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</s> <s>Should said legislation pass, the power of the federal government to arrest and detain citizens without trial or access to attorney, to search private homes without warrant or notice, to tap telephone and computer communications, and to keep vital information secreted away from the eyes of the public, would be greatly enhanced.</s></p>
<p><s>In the days leading up to the mandated Congressional debate regarding said legislation, terror warnings suddenly bloom like nightshade.</s> <s>The White House or the FBI or the CIA, or all three in concert, ratchet up the national tension level with forecasts of doom and death and fire from unknown quarters.</s> <s>Said legislation passes without so much as leaving a wake in its path, nothing explodes, and everyone goes on with their lives in the belief that they just narrowly dodged a bullet.</s> <s>At the conclusion of the process, the foundations of American freedom have been redacted, edited, clipped and round-filed.</s></p>
<p><s>The PATRIOT Act was passed in such a fashion.</s> <s>When that bill came up, the entire country was collecting its mail with oven mitts on to avoid exposure to anthrax, despite the fact that Democratic Senators like Patrick Leahy and Tom Daschle were the intended targets of this assassination attempt.</s> <s>The media got its dose of the poison, ensuring that all publicly aired conversation regarding the legislation would be coated with a veneer of hysteria.</s> <s>All of us were going to get 'thraxed, and so let us pass this ruinously contra-constitutional legislation without even reading it.</s> <s>I'd bet some serious folding green that many of the Senators who voted the thing into existence a year ago still haven't read it.</s></p>
<p><s>Sometimes, this has happened when no legislation is pending.</s> <s>Sometimes, this happens when Mr.</s> <s>Bush and his pals feel they have too much light on them.</s> <s>When Time and Newsweek came out with blazing cover stories, and the headline "Bush Knew," when word got out that the administration had been warned specifically and in detail about terrorist plans to hijack airplanes and slam them into buildings, all of a sudden the threat siren began howling.</s> <s>They're going to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge!</s> <s>They're going to blow up the Statue of Liberty!</s> <s>Run for your lives!</s></p>
<p><s>Needless to say, those structures still stand.</s> <s>No one is talking about "Bush Knew" anymore, though.</s></p>
<p><s>Hm.</s></p>
<p><s>Like clockwork this happens.</s> <s>Cut this phenomenon with Occam's Razor - "all things being equal, the simplest explanation is usually the correct one" - and the word 'coincidence' becomes hard to spit out.</s></p>
<p><s>It happened again last week.</s></p>
<p><s>Legislation to create a Department of Homeland Security has wended its way towards Congressional approval.</s> <s>If passed, this legislation would signal the largest reorganization of the federal government since the passage of the National Security Act in 1947.</s> <s>Line items within the legislation:</s></p>
<p><s>* Eliminate vital aspects of the Freedom of Information Act, allowing the government and private corporate contractors to operate completely in secret and beyond citizen oversight;</p>
<p><s>* Create something called a 'Total Information Awareness' program within the Defense Department.</s> <s>Conservative columnist and former Nixon aide William Safire summed up succinctly what this will do.</s> <s>"Every purchase you make with a credit card, every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill, every Web site you visit and e-mail you send or receive, every academic grade you receive, every bank deposit you make, every trip you book and every event you attend - all these transactions and communications will go into what the Defense Department describes as 'a virtual, centralized grand database.'</s> <s>To this computerized dossier on your private life from commercial sources, add every piece of information that government has about you -- passport application, driver's license and bridge toll records, judicial and divorce records, complaints from nosy neighbors to the F.B.I., your lifetime paper trail plus the latest hidden camera surveillance."</s></p>
<p><s>* Redefines the term 'Terrorism.'</s> <s>Before, 'Terrorism' involved explosions, murder, kidnapping and any activity that used violence to frighten civilians and change the manner in which a government functioned.</s> <s>Under the new legislation, the definition of 'Terrorism' is expanded.</s> <s>Now, 'Terrorism' is defined as an act that, "Is a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State or other subdivision of the United States," or "Appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population."</s> <s>Protests against the government or against a private contractor involved with the government are intended to 'coerce' the civilian population.</s> <s>Loitering is a criminal offense.</s> <s>If you do either of these from now on, you may consider yourself welcomed into the ranks of international terrorism.</s> <s>Seriously.</s></p>
<p><s>* Deletes any possibility of an effective independent investigation into what went wrong on September 11th, thanks to the aforementioned FOIA restrictions.</s></p>
<p><s>One would think so profound a sea change in the essential rights and freedoms of the citizenry would be subject to intense Congressional debate, no?</s> <s>After all, it took Congress two years of discussion to nail down the specifics and the fine print of the National Security Act.</s> <s>This is important stuff here.</s></p>
<p><s>Like clockwork comes the klaxon CNN headline on November 15th: 'FBI Warns al Qaeda Planning "Spectacular" Attack.'</s></p>
<p><s>Spectacular, no less.</s></p>
<p><s>Like clockwork comes the voice of Osama, prophesying death and doom from beyond the grave.</s> <s>Wasn't he dead for a while?</s> <s>This fellow has made more comebacks than Elvis, and always in time to redirect the national dialogue away from discussing the ways and means of incredibly important legislation.</s></p>
<p><s>All 484 pages of the Homeland Security Department legislation will pass through Congress soon, likely unread by a majority of those casting the votes.</s> <s>At some point, the teeth of this legislation will sink in, but it will be too late to do much of anything about it.</s> <s>If anyone tries, you can be sure of a new burst of incredibly dire warnings coming down from on high.</s> <s>Osama bin Laden is under your bed.</s> <s>He's alive again, and planning to eat your children.</s> <s>Head for the hills, and never mind your constitutional rights.</s></p>
<p><s>They will keep doing this until someone calls them on it, out loud and in public.</s></p>
<T Privatizace>
<C Chapter 1>
<p><s>Although privatisation in Central and Eastern Europe has often been described incorrectly as merely a technical undertaking, it is perhaps more helpful to think of it as among the most important building blocks for newly flourishing democracies.</s> <s>While creating market economies and achieving greater economic efficiency are obviously central aims of the privatisation process, so too are improving state finances, reducing the state's administrative burden, securing greater social justice, fighting corruption, and creating a broad basis of support for market reforms.</s> <s>Behind these worthwhile goals there are undoubtedly also a slew of private interests at work. Broadly speaking, therefore, privatisation can both reflect and shape many critical features of newly democratic systems, nascent capitalist economic structures and emerging civil societies.</s></p>
<p><s>Effective privatisation almost paradoxically demands the positive presence of the state.</s> <s>Governments are the key protagonist in redrawing the lines between market and state.</s> <s>To argue, as some have, that states should simply unburden themselves as quickly as possible of the assets they have inherited gravely underestimates both the complexity of the problem and the legitimate obligations of states to build transparent, rule-based markets as a precondition to privatisation.</s> <s>The current Russian crisis illustrates elements of this problem.</s></p>
<p><s>Privatisation represents a high-stakes undertaking, and in Central Europe it has unfolded in the context of profound political, social and economic transformation.</s> <s>The British government under Margaret Thatcher only privatised 5% of commercial assets over a ten-year period, whereas Central European governments have privatised over 50% of business activity in just over a half decade. Western and Eastern privatisation experiences have thus differed both quantitatively and qualitatively.</s></p>
<p><s>Defining privatisation is not as easy as it might seem, for privatisation can broadly imply the degree to which economic activity is controlled by private operators, or more narrowly describe only the process by which the state off-loads publicly-owned companies to the market.</s> <s>The first definition would measure the extent to which new private "start-up" companies have emerged as well as the presence of foreign-owned firms in the domestic economy once a market liberalisation regime is in place.</s> <s>The second definition refers only to the methods newly democratised and capitalist oriented states employ to sell their "inherited" commercial patrimony.</s></p>
<p><s>In this report, privatisation is placed it a fairly broad context.</s> <s>Here it is argued that successful privatisation not only involves the transfer of state-held assets to private hands, but also demands the proper restructuring of capital markets and the execution of sound macro-economic policies needed to nurture newly privatised firms.</s> <s>It also, perhaps paradoxically, requires the failure of those companies which, simply put, are beyond redemption while implicitly acknowledging the existence of a sufficiently resilient civil society capable of shouldering many of the burdens once assumed by the state.</s></p>
<p><s>All of these factors are closely intertwined.</s> <s>Indeed, the extent to which the state has off-loaded state-owned firms, and as far as these firms have either restructured or been allowed to suffer the consequences - the process Schumpeter called "creative destruction" - can unambiguously shape the general macro-economic climate in which new entrepreneurs must operate.</s> <s>Often a transition society is better off abandoning loss-making investments than it is trying to resuscitate enterprises which, for various reasons, are simply unworkable.</s> <s>Propping up clinically dead enterprises can plunder capital markets, penalise vibrant companies and contribute to inflation, balance of payments difficulties and budgetary shortfalls.</s> <s>From another angle, the sale of state-owned companies will accomplish little if a stable macro-economic order is not in place, and if the local market lacks a transparent legal and administrative structure rendering the rules of the game both clear and fair.</s> <s>Ultimate success in privatisation thus hinges not only on the state's effectiveness in selling national industries to private operators, but also upon its capacity to reduce inflation, eliminate administered pricing, work out proper bankruptcy procedures, restrain public spending, enforce market rules, and construct an efficient tax structure.</s> <s>High inflation, for example, fosters a very uncertain environment for investment just as an overly tight monetary policy can weaken firms by curtailing demand.</s></p>
<p><s>The broader definition of privatisation must also incorporate the state's capacity to foster a favourable financial structure capable of generating capital resources needed both to underwrite the purchase of huge stocks of state-owned assets and to restructure in a discerning fashion these long-neglected assets.</s> <s>This requires either the deepening of capital markets, or policies which somehow compensate for the dearth of locally available capital.</s> <s>The voucher system of privatisation is the most commonly used of these innovative devises, but it alone cannot conjure capital from thin air.</s> <s>By engaging a mass of capital-less investors, many of whom lack a basic understanding of the market, the voucher system can also lead to serious problems of corporate governance.</s> <s>Engaging strategic investors with a proven track record and setting up well-structured internationally oriented equities markets provide a more reliable vehicles for corporate financing.</s></p>
<C Chapter 2>
<p><s>The need to shed extensive state assets rapidly and in an orderly fashion has compelled government officials to employ numerous privatisation methods.</s> <s>The most visible form of these entails the direct sale of huge state-owned firms which were the very embodiment of the Communist economic model.</s> <s>But the transfer of small and medium firms, shops and farms is also critical to the privatisation process as is the restitution of property or its equivalent to former owners in order to establish a strong foundation for future property rights.</s> <s>Yet, the full restitution of all property rights as they existed in the pre-Communist era is virtually an impossible task and this process is therefore likely to be fraught with political compromises.</s></p>
<p><s>There are several primary routes to privatisation:</s></p>
<p><s>self-transformation of a firm by which the state merely establishes guidelines and allows the firm then to privatise itself;</p>
<p><s>"small privatisation" through the sale or leasing of small state assets such as shops and restaurants;</p>
<p><s>privatisation of small- and medium-sized firms employing 100-500 workers either through employee or management buy-outs or by closing down these firms and auctioning off their assets;</p>
<p><s>"classical privatisation", by which the state auctions assets to the highest bidder;</p>
<p><s>"mass privatisation" by which shares and share options or vouchers are distributed widely throughout society at no or very low cost;</p>
<p><s>"covert privatisation" or the hidden transfer of assets though distorted pricing arrangements, for example, by secretly selling firm assets to private operators, oftentimes at excessively low prices;</p>
<p><s>"organic" or "growth privatisation" which simply permits the state sector to wither away while the private sector expands and,</p>
<p><s>direct sales to strategic investors capable of injecting fresh capital and introducing experienced management and sales networks.</s></p>
<p><s>Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic employed many of these techniques at various times or applied some of these techniques to certain sectors and other techniques to other sectors.</s> <s>Careful scrutiny of privatisation in each of these three countries reveals important differences in method and results, but also some similarities.</s></p>
<p><s>Small shops were normally auctioned off quickly in the three countries, and this proved to be one of the more successful elements of privatisation.</s> <s>Auction sales, however, were more rare the larger the firm due to capital shortages and insufficient demand for large and often loss-making enterprises.</s> <s>National authorities generally transformed large firms into joint stock companies.</s> <s>The state, a ministry or a holding company then nominally "owned" shares in the new joint stock company.</s> <s>This granted the "owner" certain powers of control, ultimately making it possible to transfer part or all of the assets to private market operators.</s> <s>This transfer constitutes formal privatisation. Yet, the process was often slowed by deliberations over which social and economic groups were to have access to shares, the method for establishing the sale price, the role foreign capital has to play, and problems on the demand side. Often, the most prized assets were sold off earlier, while states held crises-ridden "dinosaurs" ostensibly in the hope that restructuring would render these firms more valuable in the eyes of potential purchasers.</s> <s>More importantly, governments feared allowing firms with thousands of employees to fail.</s> <s>Finally, transition governments have also had to ensure that the private and state sectors compete on an equal footing.</s> <s>This requires a dramatic reduction in subsidies to the industries remaining in state hands.</s></p>
<p><s>When shares in a state-owned firm are made available on the market, who actually is invited to participate in their purchase can be of decisive long-term importance.</s> <s>Potential shareholders include the general public, investment funds, employees, management and selected "strategic investors", who often represent foreign firms or financial institutions.</s> <s>The degree of ownership concentration is also critical.</s> <s>Diffuse or "mass" ownership structures, most evident in the Czech Republic but also found in Poland, hypothetically lend themselves to a kind of popular capitalism, compensate for capital shortages, and improve the potential for portfolio diversification.</s> <s>Yet no real new capital is generated this way, and having so many "owners" can contribute to passive management oversight which can then bog down restructuring. Mass privatisation is also an expensive undertaking and can pose administrative difficulties.</s></p>
<p><s>Mass ownership schemes are not the only source of corporate governance problems.</s> <s>If a firm's workers own a large share in the enterprise, shedding labour, which may be crucial to the firm's ultimate survival, can prove exceedingly difficult.</s> <s>On the other hand, labour's role as a shareholder might help impart a broader "capital holder's" perspective on the labour force and potentially make it more willing to make certain concessions designed to improve long-term competitiveness.</s> <s>One can also argue that if high-ranking managers from the old nomenklatura gain control over ownership shares, their primary instincts could well be to shield the firm from, rather than prepare it for, the global economy.</s> <s>There is also the risk that the public could associate the market system with that nomenklatura, something which threatens to de-legitimise the market at the outset.</s> <s>On the other hand, if management has adjusted quickly to new conditions, allowing it a stake in share ownership could prove a powerful mechanism for improving efficiency.</s></p>
<p><s>There are cases in which the primary instincts of management could well be to shield the firm from, rather than prepare it for the rigors of the global economy.</s> <s>Subsidies and protectionism tend to reinforce those instincts.</s> <s>On the other hand, in a competitive climate, management might respond more quickly to market signals when it also holds ownership stakes.</s></p>
<p><s>A third set of issues involves the pace of privatisation.</s> <s>Here there is still a great debate regarding whether it is best to off-load state assets quickly and let the private sector oversee the process of restructuring, or alternatively to undertake privatisation slowly, allowing the state or hired "proxies" initially to assume restructuring responsibilities.</s> <s>Those who support the rapid approach argue that it renders privatisation irreversible, denies bureaucrats an opportunity to influence the process and grants capital markets and consumers the final say in determining a firm's viability.</s> <s>This argument, however, presupposes an orderly and transparent sell-off, relatively united public opinion, a developed capital market, a stable macro-economic climate and investor interest in state assets - all of which may actually require some time to achieve.</s></p>
<p><s>Indeed, by moving slowly, the state can perhaps ensure that there is sufficient capital available to purchase assets at prices reflecting underlying value.</s> <s>Some argue that by delaying privatisation, firms can begin the process of restructuring somewhat insulated from the harsh winds of global competition.</s> <s>Upper management thereby is granted sufficient time to hire new personnel with the experience to operate in global conditions, and insofar as is possible, begin to invest in new plant and machinery while shedding excess capacity and functionally unemployed workers still on the payroll.</s> <s>If this process is carried out well, when the firm is finally fully privatised, it will both attract a higher price than it would have had it been privatised immediately - something which obviously brings much needed resources into state coffers - and enjoy better odds of surviving in the international economy.</s> <s>More importantly, suddenly flooding the market with a vast array of assets will naturally greatly depress their collective value.</s> <s>Thus states must carefully monitor market conditions before tendering offers.</s> <s>Moreover, by selectively withholding assets from the market, inevitable job losses and output changes can be staggered over time, effectively spreading out these shocks and giving the public and the market time to accommodate themselves both politically and economically to the modalities of the market.</s> <s>With few exceptions, the inauguration of economic transition introduced radical falls in GDP, but these falls might well have been even greater had Central and East European states sought to privatise all state-owned enterprises in one fell swoop.</p>
<p><s>Ultimately officials must make difficult judgements about which firms can survive market exposure quickly, which ones need time and resources to prepare themselves, and most difficult of all, which firms are simply beyond redemption and should be allowed to fail in order to free up resources for those firms with a fighting chance of survival.</s> <s>One should also distinguish between questions involving the pace of privatisation with very important set of issues surrounding the rate of macro-economic adjustment.</s> <s>Poland, for example, was very quick to introduce draconian macro-economic policies designed to wring out inflation and budget deficits quickly but was far slower in embarking upon the privatisation of large industry.</s> <s>Czech leaders proved far more anxious to privatise as quickly as possible, but the financial system effectively shielded many firms from the harsh winds of competition and thereby delayed genuine restructuring.</s> <s>The Hungarians, after several years in policy limbo, only sped up the reform process dramatically in 1995 in conjunction with the introduction of a tough austerity policy.</s></p>
<p><s>Financing privatisation and restructuring are also critical and obviously shape long-term prospects for firms.</s> <s>The dilemmas are manifold.</s> <s>How do societies, which for years failed to accumulate adequate reserves of capital needed for investment, suddenly come up with the resources to purchase shares in privatising companies?</s></p>
<p><s>Foreign investors are often the only economic actors with sufficient access to capital to bid on large state-owned firms, and they may possess the knowledge, resource, technology, and commercial networks to transform loss makers into profitable operations.</s> <s>Foreign investors can fill the gap in know-how while linking the newly privatised firms directly into the global economy.</s> <s>Finally foreign firms set new management, technological and marketing standards to which local producers must respond.</s> <s>In this sense, they help ratchet up the competitiveness of the entire economy.</s> <s>On the down side, giving foreign producers free reign in local markets can mean that valuable assets slip from national to foreign control, and even the appearance of waning "economic sovereignty" can generate significant political problems.</s> <s>On the other hand, vigorous economic nationalism represents a fast track to economic disaster.</s></p>
<p><s>Finally, privatisation cannot succeed without an adequate legal and institutional structure in place, general social accommodation to the altered parameters of economic life and a reasonable degree of macro-economic stability.</s> <s>The whole idea of risk, for example, was virtually unheard of in the old Communist system.</s> <s>Yet, it is central to capitalism, and society must somehow accept its place in economic life.</s> <s>The institutional and macroeconomic frameworks established by the state becomes a central vehicle for reconciling the general public to such unfamiliar norms.</s> <s>Perhaps the state's most important function, therefore, is to lay out rules of the game and help inculcate the society in market norms.</s> <s>Laws governing share trading, for example, must be transparent and enforced because pervasive stock market corruption will only feed public fears and cynicism and can de-legitimise the market.</s> <s>Hyperinflation has similar effects.</s></p>
<C Chapter 3>
<p><s>The experience of these three countries can be instructive for officials elsewhere who are leading efforts to move state administered economies toward privately organised markets, and a number of lessons are apparent.</s></p>
<p><s>There are certainly justifiable reasons why a transition state might choose not to move too quickly to sell off its industrial patrimony, although this should not be an excuse for inaction.</s> <s>There are also compelling reasons why speed can be essential, particularly if there are fears that inaction might encourage the old management to strip away assets for their personal gain.</s> <s>Clearly a balance has to be struck, and this will ultimately depend on local conditions, political realities and whether a proper market and regulatory framework is in place.</s> <s>Certainly when immediate privatisation is not possible, the state can at least begin the commercialisation and restructuring process while the firms are still under its wing, and it is certainly unwise to sell before market rules are spelled out and the macro-economic stabilisation is well underway.</s> <s>Indeed, hasty privatisation means little if there is hyper-inflation or if proper regulatory environment is not put in place.</s> <s>An under-regulated stock market can subject newly privatised firms to pressures that gravely complicate restructuring.</s> <s>Regulated equities markets, on the other hand, not only funnel capital to potentially viable companies, but also act as a kind of gage with which to judge the effectiveness of management.</s></p>
<p><s>Foreign investors are a vital source of capital and know-how and set important new technology and managerial standards.</s> <s>Government officials should endeavour to ensure that these important actors are able to operate under transparent conditions and are not subject to discrimination.</s></p>
<p><s>Mass voucher privatisation, if not properly structured, can lead to poor corporate governance and provide the state with a way to maintain control over formally privatised companies.</s> <s>This is particularly true if state-owned banks or even ministries acquire shares in investment funds which aggregate vouchers.</s> <s>Conflicts of interest become apparent when state banks own large shares in the funds owning the firms to which they are also lending and this invariably distorts the allocation of capital.</s> <s>When this occurs, restructuring becomes all the more difficult as political considerations could unduly shape management thinking.</s> <s>At the same time, some degree of ownership consolidation is essential to ensure effective corporate governance.</s> <s>Bringing in strategic investors can thus be very helpful.</s></p>
<p><s>Ownership consolidation makes strong governance possible and strategic investors should be encouraged to enter transition markets.</s></p>
<p><s>Direct sales through transparent and open auctions have the virtue of cutting firms off quickly from state capital and can bring in resources to the state quickly.</s> <s>Moreover, auctions help ensure that capital is more likely to be allocated based on bottom-line economic considerations.</s></p>
<p><s>Banking privatisation is critical to the introduction of market forces.</s> <s>If the state continues to administer or subsidise banks throughout the privatisation process, there is a risk of politicising credit allocation, which, in turn, can blunt the drive to restructure bloated and inefficient industries.</s> <s>Banking privatisation should also involve writing-off bad debts so that potential investors can come to a reasonable approximation of a bank's current and potential value.</s></p>
<p><s>Officials in transition states must recognise that bankruptcy plays a vital role in capitalism and should be considered part of the privatisation process.</s> <s>In brutal terms, enterprise failure clears away non-viable enterprise and ultimately helps firms with more potential to survive by freeing up highly scarce capital.</s> <s>Of course, this is easier said than done, and no politician would want to make this the central plank in his or her re-election campaign.</s> <s>Nevertheless, the bankruptcy in today's headline can, over the medium term, facilitate more sustainable job creation.</s></p>
<p><s>Newly privatised industries are better off in the long run if they are able to operate in an environment in which prices are not regulated.</s> <s>Regulated prices blunt the signals firms need to restructure properly and make it possible to postpone painful decisions which are better made early in an investment cycle.</s></p>
<p><s>Labour issues are clearly another critical element of privatisation.</s> <s>Selling off state-owned industries itself requires, at the very least, the tacit consent of the work force if it is to succeed economically and politically.</s> <s>But this is not easy, particularly as selling state-owned companies, virtually by definition, strips away decades of cherished job security.</s> <s>On the other hand, privatisation can be very rewarding to that workforce over the long term and a successful economic transition will invariably lead to rising wages in tandem with rising productivity.</s> <s>Appropriate incentives must be put in place to encourage workers and their unions to embrace this new logic.</s> <s>This is never easy and may require years of patient negotiation.</s> <s>One strategy might be to encourage an enterprise's work force to acquire minority shares in newly privatised firms.</s> <s>The state should offer assistance to those that do lose their work and re-training is one very fruitful way to prepare them for the new economy.</s> <s>Retraining and tax credits designed to bring unemployed back to the work force can help ensure that the transition process brings long-run benefits to a broader range of society by ensuring that human capital is not squandered in the process.</s> <s>Such policies can bring important social as well as economic benefits not only to transition societies but to Western ones as well.</s></p>
<p><s>Management too must also accommodate itself to the new modalities of the market.</s> <s>This is not as easy as it would seem, particularly as competition can put pressure on top managers to cut back layers of professional staff accumulated over years of centralised state economic management.</s> <s>At the same time, infusions of fresh blood and retraining can be critical to revitalising this important component of the workforce.</s> <s>Here, too, the presence of foreign investors can be of particular benefit.</s></p>
<p><s>Finally, the overall privatisation strategy should not neglect agricultural privatisation and reform.</s> <s>A backward agricultural sector can burden the entire economy by commanding large infusions of state spending.</s> <s>Although there is a general tendency in many developed and developing countries to exclude agriculture from the rules of the market, many market rules are perfectly applicable to the farming sector.</s> <s>Along these lines, foreign capital should not be excluded from rural privatisation and restructuring process as its presence can prove a genuine impetus to modernisation.</s></p>

<C CHAPTER 1>
<p><s>The science which has grown up around linguistic facts passed through three successive phases before coming to terms with its one and only true object of study.</s></p>
<p><s>First of all came what was called 'grammar'.</s> <s>This discipline, first instituted by the Greeks and continued mainly by the French, is based on logic.</s> <s>It offers no scientific or objective approach to a language as such.</s> <s>Grammar aims solely at providing rules which distinguish between correct and incorrect forms.</s> <s>It is a prescriptive discipline, far removed from any concern with impartial observation, and its outlook is inevitably a narrow one.</s></p>
<p><s>Next came philology.</s> <s>At Alexandria there had been a 'philological' school, but the term is chiefly applied to the scientific movement inaugurated by Friedrich August Wolf in 1777, which still thrives today.</s> <s>Linguistic structure, however, is not the central concern of philology.</s> <s>Philology seeks primarily to establish, interpret and comment upon texts.</s> <s>This main preoccupation leads to a concern with literary history, customs, institutions, etc..</s> <s>In all these areas, philology applies its own method, which is that of criticism.</s> <s>Insofar as it touches upon linguistic questions, these arise principally in the comparison of texts of different periods, in establishing the language characteristic of each writer, and in deciphering and interpreting inscriptions couched in some archaic or problematic language.</s> <s>Such research undoubtedly paved the way for historical linguistics: Hitachi's work on Plautus may be described as 'linguistic'.</s> <s>But in this field philological criticism has one failing: it is too slavishly subservient to the written language, and so neglects the living language.</s> <s>Furthermore, its concern is almost exclusively with Greek and Roman antiquity.</s></p>
<p><s>The third period began when it was discovered that languages could be compared with one another.</s> <s>That discovery ushered in comparative philology, or 'comparative grammar'.</s> <s>In 1816, in a work entitled The Sanskrit Conjugation System, Franz Bopp studied the connexions between Sanskrit, Germanic, Greek, Latin, etc.</s> <s>Bopp was not the first to observe these affinities or to consider that all these languages belonged to the same family.</s> <s>In that respect Bopp had been forestalled, notably by the English orientalist W. Jones (d. 1794).</s></p>
<p><s>But isolated statements here and there do not prove that in 1816 there was already a general understanding of the significance and importance of the facts in question.</s> <s>Although Bopp cannot be credited with having discovered the relationship between Sanskrit and various languages of Europe and Asia, he did see that connexions between related languages could furnish the data for an autonomous science.</s> <s>What was new was the elucidation of one language by reference to a related language, explaining the forms of one by appeal to the forms of the other.</s></p>
<p><s>It is doubtful whether Bopp would have been able to inaugurate his science - or at least to inaugurate it so quickly - without the discovery of Sanskrit.</s> <s>Sanskrit, as a third source of evidence beside Greek and Latin, provided a broader and sounder basis for study.</s> <s>In addition, as luck would have it, Sanskrit happens to be exceptionally well situated to provide illuminating linguistic comparisons.</s></p>
<p><s>For example, suppose we take the paradigms of Latin genus and Greek genos: genus, generis, genere, genera, generum, etc.</s> <s>genos, geneos, genet, genea, geneon, etc.</s> <s>These series of forms tell us little, either on their own or when compared with one another.</s> <s>But they tell us a great deal as soon as we set beside them the corresponding Sanskrit forms: ganas, ganasas, ganasi, ganassu, ganasdm, etc.</s> <s>At a glance we now can see the relationship between the Greek and Latin paradigms.</s> <s>On the hypothesis - which seems explanatorily a productive one — that Sanskrit ganas represents the primitive form, one concludes that s fell in the Greek forms gene(s)os etc.</s> <s>wherever it occurred between vowels.</s> <s>A further conclusion is that under the same conditions s became r in Latin.</s> <s>Moreover, as regards grammatical analysis, the Sanskrit paradigm makes it evident that the stem of these forms is the stable and clearly isolable element ganas-.</s> <s>Only early Latin and early Greek ever had the primitive system preserved in Sanskrit.</s> <s>So it emerges that the maintenance of Proto-Indo-European s in all cases is what makes Sanskrit illuminating in this instance.</s> <s>It is true that in other respects Sanskrit remains less faithful to the original prototype forms: it plays havoc with the original vowel system, for example.</s> <s>But in general the primitive elements which it maintains are vital for purposes of reconstruction.</s> <s>By chance it happens to be a language which is remarkably useful in throwing light on those languages related to it.</s></p>
<p><s>Along with Bopp there emerged straight away a number of linguists of distinction: Jacob Grimm, the founder of Germanic studies (his German Grammar was published 1822 - 1836); Pott, whose etymological researches provided linguists with a great deal of material; Kuhn, who worked both in linguistics and in comparative mythology, the Sanskritist Benfey and Aufrecht, and others.</s></p>
<p><s>Finally, among the later representatives of that school, special mention must be made of Max Muller, G.</s> <s>Curtius and A.</s> <s>Schleicher.</s> <s>All three, in various ways, made important contributions to comparative studies.</s> <s>Max Muller popularised the subject in a series of brilliant if somewhat superficial lectures (Lectures on the Science of Language, 1861).</s> <s>Curtius, a distinguished philologist, known principally as the author of Principles of Greek Etymology (1879), was one of the first to reconcile comparative grammar with classical philology.</s> <s>Classical philologists had looked upon the progress made by the comparativists with less than enthusiasm, and the feeling had become mutual.</s> <s>Schleicher, finally, was the first to attempt a codification of the results of research on points of detail.</s> <s>His Concise Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Languages (1861) represents a systematisation of the science founded by Bopp.</s> <s>It is a volume which has remained of great value for many years, and it gives a better idea than any other book of what the comparativist school which dominated this first period of Indo-European linguistics stood for.</s></p>
<p><s>But although no one would deny that the comparativists succeeded in opening up a new and profitable field of investigation, they did not manage to found a true science of linguistics.</s> <s>For they never took very great care to define exactly what it was they were studying.</s> <s>And until this elementary step is taken, no science can hope to establish its own methods.</s></p>
<p><s>The first mistake made by the comparative philologists was one which contains the seeds of all their other mistakes.</s> <s>Their investigations, which were in any case limited to the Indo-European languages, show a failure to inquire into the significance of the linguistic comparisons they established and the connexions they discovered.</s> <s>Comparative grammar was exclusively comparative, instead of being historical.</s> <s>Comparison is no doubt essential for all historical reconstruction.</s> <s>But in itself comparison does not warrant drawing conclusions.</s> <s>And the right conclusion was all the more likely to elude the comparativists because they looked upon the development of two languages much as a naturalist might look upon the growth of two plants.</s> <s>Schleicher, for example, always starts from Proto-Indo-European, which seems at first sight a strictly historical approach; but he does not hesitate to treat Greek e and o as two 'grades' (Stufen) of the same vowel.</s> <s>This is because Sanskrit has a system of vowel alternations which suggests this notion of grades.</s> <s>So Schleicher takes Greek o as a reinforced vocalic grade of e, in the same way as he takes Sanskrit a to be a reinforced grade of a\ rather as if these grades were stages that vowels would go through separately but in parallel development in each language, like plants of the same species passing through the same phases of growth.</s> <s>Whereas in fact we are dealing here with a Proto-Indo-European alternation which has different reflexes in Greek and Sanskrit.</s> <s>There is no necessary parity between the results in the grammars of these two languages (cf.</s> <s>p.</s> <s>[217] ff.).</s></p>
<p><s>An exclusively comparative approach of this kind brings with it a whole series of mistaken notions.</s> <s>They have no basis in reality and fail to reflect the conditions which do obtain in language everywhere.</s> <s>At that time languages were looked upon as belonging to a province of their own, a fourth realm of nature.</s> <s>Hence forms of reasoning were permissible which would have shocked any other science.</s> <s>Nowadays, one cannot read even a few lines of what was written by the linguists of that period without being struck by their bizarre ways of thinking about language and the bizarre terms they used in order to validate them.</s></p>
<p><s>From a methodological point of view, however, it is of some interest to be acquainted with these errors.</s> <s>The mistakes a science makes in its initial stages present a magnified picture of the mistakes made by individuals starting out on scientific research.</s> <s>We shall have occasion to point out various instances of this later.</s></p>
<p><s>Not until about 1870 did anyone begin to inquire into the conditions governing the life of languages.</s> <s>It was then realised that correspondences between languages reflect only one aspect of language, and that comparison is only a tool, a method to be employed for reconstructing the facts.</s></p>
<p><s>Linguistics properly so called, in which comparison was relegated to its proper place, emerged from the study of the Romance and Germanic languages.</s> <s>Romance studies, founded by Diez, whose Grammar of the Romance languages dates from 1836-1838, contributed in particular to bringing linguistics nearer to its true object of study.</s> <s>The fact is that Romance scholars found themselves in a privileged position not enjoyed by their Indo-European colleagues.</s> <s>Latin, the prototype of the Romance languages, was itself an attested language.</s> <s>Furthermore, the wealth of available texts made it possible to follow the evolution of the different varieties of Romance in some detail.</s> <s>These two circumstances restricted the scope of speculation and gave Romance studies a particularly matter-of-fact approach.</s> <s>Germanic scholars were in a similar position.</s> <s>Although Proto-Germanic is not itself attested, the evolution of those languages descended from it can be followed over the course of many centuries through copious documentary evidence.</s> <s>So those who studied Germanic, being in more direct contact with reality, came to look at language in a different way from the early Indo-European scholars.</s></p>
<p><s>Some first steps in the right direction were taken by the American scholar Whitney, author of The Life of Language (1875).</s> <s>Shortly afterwards a new school arose, the Neogrammarians (Junggrammatiker), whose leading figures were all Germans: K. Brugmann, H. Osthoff, the Germanic specialists W. Braune, E. Sievers, H. Paul, and the Slavist Leskien, and others.</s> <s>The achievement of the Neogrammarians was to place all the results of comparative philology in a historical perspective, so that linguistic facts were connected in their natural sequence.</s> <s>The Neogrammarians no longer looked upon a language as an organism developing of its own accord, but saw it as a product of the collective mind of a linguistic community.</s> <s>At the same time, there emerged a realisation of the errors and inadequacies of the concepts associated with philology and comparative grammar.</s> <s>However, great as were the advances made by the Neogrammarians, it cannot be said that they shed light upon the fundamental problems of general linguistics, which still await a solution today.</s></p>
<C CHAPTER 2>
<p><s>Linguistics takes for its data in the first instance all manifestations of human language.</s> <s>Primitive peoples and civilised nations, early periods, classical periods, and periods of decadence, are all to be included.</s> <s>In each case due account must be taken not only of what is considered linguistically correct and 'elegant', but of all forms of expression.</s> <s>Furthermore, since the linguist is very often in no position to make his own linguistic observations at first hand, he cannot afford to neglect written texts, for these alone will acquaint him with the languages of far-off times or places.</s> <s>The aims of linguistics will be:</s></p>
<p><s>(a) to describe all known languages and record their history.</s> <s>This involves tracing the history of language families and, as far as possible, reconstructing the parent languages of each family;</p>
<p><s>(b) to determine the forces operating permanently and universally in all languages, and to formulate general laws which account for all particular linguistic phenomena historically attested;</p>
<p><s>(c) to delimit and define linguistics itself</s></p>
<p><s>Linguistics has very close connexions with other sciences.</s> <s>Sometimes they provide linguistics with data and sometimes linguistics provides them with data.</s> <s>The boundaries between linguistics and its neighbouring sciences are not always clearly drawn.</s> <s>For example, linguistics must be carefully distinguished from ethnography and prehistory, both of them disciplines in which linguistic facts may be utilised as evidence.</s> <s>It must likewise be distinguished from anthropology, which studies mankind as a species; whereas language is a social phenomenon.</s> <s>But ought linguistics on that account to be incorporated in sociology?</s> <s>What are the relations between linguistics and social psychology?</s> <s>In the final analyses', where languages are concerned everything has its psychological aspect, including the physical and mechanical processes, such as sound change.</s> <s>And since linguistics supplies social psychology with such essential data, are not the two mdissolubly linked?</s> <s>These are questions which will be given only brief answers here, but we shall return to them later.</s></p>
<p><s>The connexions between linguistics and physiology are less difficult to unravel.</s> <s>The relation is unilateral, in that the study of languages requires information about the physiological aspects of sound, but can supply physiology with no information in return.</s> <s>In any case, confusion between the two disciplines is impossible.</s> <s>The essence of a language, as we shall see, has nothing to do with the phonic nature of the linguistic sign.</s></p>
<p><s>The position of philology has already been clarified: it is clearly separate from linguistics, although there are points of contact between the two sciences, and they can be of mutual service.</s></p>
<p><s>Finally, we may ask, of what use is linguistics?</s> <s>Very few people have clear ideas on the subject, and this is not the place to give a detailed answer.</s> <s>However, what can be said is that for obvious reasons linguistic questions are of interest to all those, including historians, philologists and others, who need to deal with texts.</s> <s>Even more obvious is the importance of linguistics for culture in general.</s> <s>In the lives of individuals and of societies, language is a factor of greater importance than any other.</s> <s>For the study of language to remain solely the business of a handful of specialists would be a quite unacceptable state of affairs.</s> <s>In practice, the study of language is in some degree or other the concern of everyone.</s> <s>But a paradoxical consequence of this general interest is that no other subject has fostered more absurd notions, more prejudices, more illusions, or more fantasies.</s> <s>From a psychological point of view, these errors are of interest in themselves.</s> <s>But it is the primary task of the linguist to denounce them, and to eradicate them as completely as possible.</s></p>
<C CHAPTER 3>
<p>§1. On defining a language</p>
<p><s>What is it that linguistics sets out to analyse?</s> <s>What is the actual object of study in its entirety?</s> <s>The question is a particularly difficult one.</s> <s>We shall see why later.</s> <s>First, let us simply try to grasp the nature of the difficulty.</s></p>
<p><s>Other sciences are provided with objects of study given in advance, which are then examined from different points of view.</s> <s>Nothing like that is the case in linguistics.</s> <s>Suppose someone pronounces the French word nu ('naked')- At first sight, one might think this would be an example of an independently given linguistic object.</s> <s>But more careful consideration reveals a series of three or four quite different things, depending on the viewpoint adopted.</s> <s>There is a sound, there is the expression of an idea, there is a derivative of Latin nudum, and so on.</s> <s>The object is not given in advance of the viewpoint: far from it.</s> <s>Rather, one might say that it is the viewpoint adopted which creates the object.</s> <s>Furthermore, there is nothing to tell us in advance whether one of these ways of looking at it is prior to or superior to any of the others.</s></p>
<p><s>Whichever viewpoint is adopted, moreover, linguistic phenomena always present two complementary facets, each depending on the other.</s> <s>For example:</s></p>
<p><s>(1) The ear perceives articulated syllables as auditory impressions.</s> <s>But the sounds in question would not exist without the vocal organs.</s> <s>There would be no n, for instance, without these two complementary aspects to it.</s> <s>So one cannot equate the language simply with what the ear hears.</s> <s>One cannot divorce what is heard from oral articulation.</s> <s>Nor, on the other hand, can one specify the relevant movements of the vocal organs without reference to the corresponding auditory impression (cf.</s> <s>p.</s> <s>[63] ff.)</p>
<p><s>(2)  But even if we ignore this phonetic duality, would language then be reducible to phonetic facts?</s> <s>No.</s> <s>Speech sounds are only the instrument of thought, and have no independent existence.</s> <s>Here another complementarity emerges, and one of great importance.</s> <s>A sound, itself a complex auditory-articulatory unit, in turn combines with an idea to form another complex unit, both physiologically and psychologically.</s> <s>Nor is this all.</s></p>
<p><s>(3)  Language has an individual aspect and a social aspect.</s> <s>One is not conceivable without the other.</s> <s>Furthermore:</s></p>
<p><s>(4)  Language at any given time involves an established system and an evolution.</s> <s>At any given time, it is an institution in the present and a product of the past.</s> <s>At first sight, it looks very easy to distinguish between the system and its history, between what it is and what it was.</s> <s>In reality, the connexion between the two is so close that it is hard to separate them.</s> <s>Would matters be simplified if one considered the ontogenesis of linguistic phenomena, beginning with a study of children's language, for example?</s> <s>No.</s> <s>It is quite illusory to believe that wbere language is concerned the problem of origins is any different from the problem of permanent conditions.</s> <s>There is no way out of the circle.</s></p>
<p><s>So however we approach the question, no one object of linguistic study emerges of its own accord.</s> <s>Whichever way we turn, the same dilemma confronts us.</s> <s>Either we tackle each problem on one front only, and risk failing to take into account the dualities mentioned above: or else we seem committed to trying to study language in several ways simultaneously, in which case the object of study becomes a muddle of disparate, unconnected things.</s> <s>By proceeding thus one opens the door to various sciences - psychology, anthropology, prescriptive grammar, philology, and so on - which are to be distinguished from linguistics.</s> <s>These sciences could lay claim to language as falling in their domain; but their methods are not the ones that are needed.</s></p>
<p><s>One solution only, in our view, resolves all these difficulties.</s> <s>The linguist must take the study of linguistic structure as his primary concern, and relate all other manifestations of language to it.</s> <s>Indeed, amid so many dualities, linguistic structure seems to be the one thing that is independently definable and provides something our minds can satisfactorily grasp.</s></p>
<p><s>What, then, is linguistic structure?</s> <s>It is not, in our opinion, simply the same thing as language.</s> <s>Linguistic structure is only one part of language, even though it is an essential part.</s> <s>The structure of a language is a social product of our language faculty.</s> <s>At the same time, boundaries separating various domains.</s> <s>It is at the same time physical, physiological and psychological.</s> <s>It belongs both to the individual and to society.</s> <s>No classification of human phenomena provides any single place for it, because language as such has no discernible unity.</s></p>
<p><s>A language as a structured system, on the contrary, is both a self-contained whole and a principle of classification.</s> <s>As soon as we give linguistic structure pride of place among the facts of language, we introduce a natural order into an aggregate which lends itself to no other classification.</s></p>
<p><s>It might be objected to this principle of classification that our use of language depends on a faculty endowed by nature: whereas language systems are acquired and conventional, and so ought to be subordinated to - instead of being given priority over - our natural ability.</s></p>
<p><s>To this objection one might reply as follows.</s></p>
<p><s>First, it has not been established that the function of language, as manifested in speech, is entirely natural: that is to say, it is not clear that our vocal apparatus is made for speaking as our legs for walking.</s> <s>Linguists are by no means in agreement on this issue.</s> <s>Whitney, for instance, who regards languages as social institutions on exactly the same footing as all other social institutions, holds it to be a matter of chance or mere convenience that it is our vocal apparatus we use for linguistic purposes.</s> <s>Man, in his view, might well have chosen to use gestures, thus substituting visual images for sound patterns.</s> <s>Whitney's is doubtless too extreme a position.</s> <s>For languages are not in all respects similar to other social institutions (cf.</s> <s>p.[107] ff., p.[110]).</s> <s>Moreover, Whitney goes too far when he says that the selection of the vocal apparatus for language was accidental.</s> <s>For it was in some measure imposed upon us by Nature.</s> <s>But the American linguist is right about the essential point: the language we use is a convention, and it makes no difference what exactly the nature of the agreed sign is.</s> <s>The question of the vocal apparatus is thus a secondary one as far as the problem of language is concerned.</s></p>
<p><s>This idea gains support from the notion of language articulation.</s> <s>In Latin, the word articulus means 'member, part, subdivision in a sequence of things'.</s> <s>As regards language, articulation may refer to the division of the chain of speech into syllables, or to the division of the chain of meanings into meaningful units.</s> <s>It is in this sense that one speaks in German of gegliederte Sprache.</s> <s>On the basis of this second interpretation, one may say that it is not spoken language which is natural to man, but the faculty of constructing a language, i.e.</s> <s>a system of distinct signs corresponding to distinct ideas.</s></p>
<p><s>Broca discovered that the faculty of speech is localised in the third frontal frontal convolution of the left hemisphere of the brain.</s> <s> This fact has been seized upon to justify regarding language as a natural endowment.</s> <s>But the same localisation is known to hold for everything connected with language, including writing.</s> <s>Thus what seems to be indicated, when we take into consideration also the evidence from various forms of aphasia due to lesions in the centres of localisation is: (1) that the various disorders which affect spoken language are interconnected in many ways with disorders affecting written language, and (2) that in all cases of aphasia or agraphia what is affected is not so much the ability to utter or inscribe this or that, but the ability to produce in any given mode signs corresponding to normal language.</s> <s>All this leads us to believe that, over and above the functioning of the various organs, there exists a more general faculty governing signs, which may be regarded as the linguistic faculty par excellence.</s> <s>So by a different route we are once again led to the same conclusion.</s></p>
<p><s>Finally, in support of giving linguistic structure pride of place in our study of language, there is this argument: that, whether natural or not, the faculty of articulating words is put to use only by means of the linguistic instrument created and provided by society.</s> <s>Therefore it is no absurdity to say that it is linguistic structure which gives language what unity it has.</s></p>
<p>§2. Linguistic structure: its place among the facts of language</p>
<p><s>In order to identify what role linguistic structure plays within the totality of language, we must consider the individual act of speech and trace what takes place in the speech circuit.</s> <s>This act requires at least two individuals: without this minimum the circuit would not be complete.</s> <s>Suppose, then, we have two people, A and B, talking to each other:</s></p>
<p><s>The starting point of the circuit is in the brain of one individual, for instance A, where facts of consciousness which we shall call concepts are associated with representations of linguistic signs or sound patterns by means of which they may be expressed.</s> <s>Let us suppose that a given concept triggers in the brain a corresponding sound pattern.</s> <s>This is an entirely psychological phenomenon, followed in turn by a physiological process: the brain transmits to the organs of phonation an impulse corresponding to the pattern.</s> <s>Then sound waves are sent from A's mouth to B's ear: a purely physical process.</s> <s>Next, the circuit continues in B in the opposite order: from ear to brain, the physiological transmission of the sound pattern; in the brain, the psychological association of this pattern with the corresponding concept.</s> <s>If B speaks in turn, this new act will pursue - from his brain to A's -exactly the same course as the first, passing through the same successive phases, which we may represent as follows:</s></p>
<p><s>This analysis makes no claim to be complete.</s> <s>One could go on to distinguish the auditory sensation itself, the identification of that sensation with the latent sound pattern, the patterns of muscular movement associated with phonation, and so on.</s> <s>We have included only those elements considered essential; but our schematisation enables us straight away to separate the parts which are physical (sound waves) from those which are physiological (phonation and hearing) and those which are psychological (the sound patterns of words and the concepts).</s> <s>It is particularly important to note that the sound patterns of the words are not to be confused with actual sounds.</s> <s>The word patterns are psychological, just as the concepts associated with them are.</s></p>
<p><s>The circuit as here represented may be further divided:</s></p>
<p><s>(a)  into an external part (sound vibrations passing from mouth to ear) and an internal part (comprising all the rest);</p>
<p><s>(b)  into a psychological and a non-psychological part, the latter comprising both the physiological facts localised in the organs and the physical facts external to the individual; and</p>
<p><s>(c) into an active part and a passive part, the former comprising everything which goes from the association centre of one individual to the ear of the other, and the latter comprising everything which goes from an individual's ear to his own association centre.</s></p>
<p><s>Finally, in the psychological part localised in the brain, one may call everything which is active 'executive' (c -->> s), and everything which is passive 'receptive' (s --> c).</s></p>
<p><s>In addition, one must allow for a faculty of association and coordination which comes into operation as soon as one goes beyond individual signs in isolation.</s> <s>It is this faculty which plays the major role in the organisation of the language as a system (cf. p.[170] ff.).</s></p>
<p><s>But in order to understand this role, one must leave the individual act, which is merely language in embryo, and proceed to consider the social phenomenon.</s></p>
<p><s>All the individuals linguistically linked in this manner will establish among themselves a kind of mean; all of them will reproduce -doubtless not exactly, but approximately - the same signs linked to the same concepts.</s></p>
<p><s>What is the origin of this social crystallisation?</s> <s>Which of the parts of the circuit is involved?</s> <s>For it is very probable that not all of them are equally relevant.</s></p>
<p><s>The physical part of the circuit can be dismissed from consideration straight away.</s> <s>When we hear a language we do not know being spoken, we hear the sounds but we cannot enter into the social reality of what is happening, because of our failure to comprehend.</s></p>
<p><s>The psychological part of the circuit is not involved in its entirety either.</s> <s>The executive side of it plays no part, for execution is never carried out by the collectivity: it is always individual, and the individual is always master of it.</s> <s>This is what we shall designate by the term speech.</s></p>
<p><s>The individual's receptive and co-ordinating faculties build up a stock of imprints which turn out to be for all practical purposes the same as the next person's.</s> <s>How must we envisage this social product, so that the language itself can be seen to be clearly distinct from the rest?</s> <s>If we could collect the totality of word patterns stored in all those individuals, we should have the social bond which constitutes their language.</s> <s>It is a fund accumulated by the members of the community through the practice of speech, a grammatical system existing potentially in every brain, or more exactly in the brains of a group of individuals; for the language is never complete in any single individual, but exists perfectly only in the collectivity.</s></p>
<T Scientists>
<p><s>Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course.</s> <s>Human activities inflict harsh and often irreversible damage on the environment and on critical resources.</s> <s>If not checked, many of our current practices put at serious risk the future that we wish for human society and the plant and animal kingdoms, and may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know 0.</s> <s>Fundamental changes are urgent if we are to avoid the collision our present course will bring about.</s></p>
<C THE ENVIRONMENT IS SUFFERING CRITICAL STRESS>
<p>The Atmosphere</p>
<p><s>Stratospheric ozone depletion threatens us with enhanced ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, which can be damaging or lethal to many life forms.</s> <s>Air pollution near ground level, and acid precipitation, are already causing widespread injury to humans, forests, and crops.</s></p>
<p>Water Resources</p>
<p><s>Heedless exploitation of depletable ground water supplies endangers food production and other essential human systems.</s> <s>Heavy demands on the world's surface waters have resulted in serious shortages in some 80 countries, containing 40 percent of the world's population.</s> <s>Pollution of rivers, lakes, and ground water further limits the supply.</s></p>
<p>Oceans</p>
<p><s>Destructive pressure on the oceans is severe, particularly in the coastal regions which produce most of the world's food fish.</s> <s>The total marine catch is now at or above the estimated maximum sustainable yield.</s> <s>Some fisheries have already shown signs of collapse.</s> <s>Rivers carrying heavy burdens of eroded soil into the seas also carry industrial, municipal, agricultural, and livestock waste -- some of it toxic.</s></p>
<p>Soil</p>
<p><s>Loss of soil productivity, which is causing extensive land abandonment, is a widespread by-product of current practices in agriculture and animal husbandry.</s> <s>Since 1945, 11 percent of the earth's vegetated surface has been degraded -- an area larger than India and China combined -- and per capita food production in many parts of the world is decreasing.</s></p>
<p>Forests</p>
<p><s>Tropical rain forests, as well as tropical and temperate dry forests, are being destroyed rapidly.</s> <s>At present rates, some critical forest types will be gone in a few years, and most of the tropical rain forest will be gone before the end of the next century.</s> <s>With them will go large numbers of plant and animal species.</s></p>
<p>Living Species</p>
<p><s>The irreversible loss of species, which by 2100 may reach one-third of all species now living, is especially serious.</s> <s>We are losing the potential they hold for providing medicinal and other benefits, and the contribution that genetic diversity of life forms gives to the robustness of the world's biological systems and to the astonishing beauty of the earth itself.</s> <s>Much of this damage is irreversible on a scale of centuries, or permanent.</s> <s>Other processes appear to pose additional threats.</s> <s>Increasing levels of gases in the atmosphere from human activities, including carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel burning and from deforestation, may alter climate on a global scale.</s> <s>Predictions of global warming are still uncertain -- with projected effects ranging from tolerable to very severe -- but the potential risks are very great.</s></p>
<p><s>Our massive tampering with the world's interdependent web of life -- coupled with the environmental damage inflicted by deforestation, species loss, and climate change -- could trigger widespread adverse effects, including unpredictable collapses of critical biological systems whose interactions and dynamics we only imperfectly understand.</s></p>
<p><s>Uncertainty over the extent of these effects cannot excuse complacency or delay in facing the threats.</s></p>
<C POPULATION>
<p><s>The earth is finite.</s> <s>Its ability to absorb wastes and destructive effluent is finite.</s> <s>Its ability to provide food and energy is finite.</s> <s>Its ability to provide for growing numbers of people is finite.</s> <s>And we are fast approaching many of the earth's limits.</s> <s>Current economic practices which damage the environment, in both developed and underdeveloped nations, cannot be continued without the risk that vital global systems will be damaged beyond repair.</s></p>
<p><s>Pressures resulting from unrestrained population growth put demands on the natural world that can overwhelm any efforts to achieve a sustainable future.</s> <s>If we are to halt the destruction of our environment, we must accept limits to that growth.</s> <s>A World Bank estimate indicates that world population will not stabilize at less than 12.4 billion, while the United Nations concludes that the eventual total could reach 14 billion, a near tripling of today's 5.4 billion.</s> <s>But, even at this moment, one person in five lives in absolute poverty without enough to eat, and one in ten suffers serious malnutrition.</s></p>
<p><s>No more than one or a few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity immeasurably diminished.</s></p>
<C WARNING>
<p><s>We the undersigned, senior members of the world's scientific community, hereby warn all humanity of what lies ahead.</s> <s>A great change in our stewardship of the earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated.</s></p>
<C WHAT WE MUST DO>
<p><s>Five inextricably linked areas must be addressed simultaneously:</s></p>
<p><s>We must bring environmentally damaging activities under control to restore and protect the integrity of the earth's systems we depend on. </p>
<p><s>We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water.</s> <s>Priority must be given to the development of energy sources matched to Third World needs -- small-scale and relatively easy to implement.</s></p>
<p><s>We must halt deforestation, injury to and loss of agricultural land, and the loss of terrestrial and marine plant and animal species.</s></p>
<p><s>We must manage resources crucial to human welfare more effectively.</s></p>
<p><s>We must give high priority to efficient use of energy, water, and other materials, including expansion of conservation and recycling.</s></p>
<p><s>We must stabilize population.</s> <s>This will be possible only if all nations recognize that it requires improved social and economic conditions, and the adoption of effective, voluntary family planning.</s></p>
<p><s>We must reduce and eventually eliminate poverty.</s></p>
<p><s>We must ensure sexual equality, and guarantee women control over their own reproductive decisions.</s></p>
<p><s>The developed nations are the largest polluters in the world today.</s> <s>They must greatly reduce their overconsumption, if we are to reduce pressures on resources and the global environment.</s> <s>The developed nations have the obligation to provide aid and support to developing nations, because only the developed nations have the financial resources and the technical skills for these tasks.</s></p>
<p><s>Acting on this recognition is not altruism, but enlightened self-interest: whether industrialized or not, we all have but one lifeboat.</s> <s>No nation can escape from injury when global biological systems are damaged.</s> <s>No nation can escape from conflicts over increasingly scarce resources.</s> <s>In addition, environmental and economic instabilities will cause mass migrations with incalculable consequences for developed and undeveloped nations alike.</s></p>
<p><s>Developing nations must realize that environmental damage is one of the gravest threats they face, and that attempts to blunt it will be overwhelmed if their populations go unchecked.</s> <s>The greatest peril is to become trapped in spirals of environmental decline, poverty, and unrest, leading to social, economic, and environmental collapse.</s></p>
<p><s>Success in this global endeavor will require a great reduction in violence and war.</s> <s>Resources now devoted to the preparation and conduct of war -- amounting to over $1 trillion annually -- will be badly needed in the new tasks and should be diverted to the new challenges.</s></p>
<p><s>A new ethic is required -- a new attitude towards discharging our responsibility for caring for ourselves and for the earth.</s> <s>We must recognize the earth's limited capacity to provide for us.</s> <s>We must recognize its fragility.</s> <s>We must no longer allow it to be ravaged.</s> <s>This ethic must motivate a great movement, convincing reluctant leaders and reluctant governments and reluctant peoples themselves to effect the needed changes.</s></p>
<p><s>The scientists issuing this warning hope that our message will reach and affect people everywhere.</s> <s>We need the help of many.</s></p>
<p><s>We require the help of the world community of scientists -- natural, social, economic, and political.</s></p>
<p><s>We require the help of the world's business and industrial leaders.</s></p>
<p><s>We require the help of the world's religious leaders.</s> <s>We require the help of the world's peoples.</s></p>
<p><s>We call on all to join us in this task.</s></p>
